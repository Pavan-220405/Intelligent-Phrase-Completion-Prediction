bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last bennet replied that he had not. but it is returned she for long has just been here and she told me all about it. bennet made no answer. do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently. you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it. this was invitation enough. why my dear you must know long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week. what is his name bingley. is he married or single oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls how so how can it affect them my dear bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them. is that his design in settling here design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes. i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them bingley might like you the best of the party. my dear you flatter me. i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five grown-up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty. in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of. but my dear you must indeed go and see bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood. it is more than i engage for i assure you. but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers. indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not. you are over scrupulous surely. i dare say bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy. i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving her the preference. they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves. you mistake me my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least. ah you do not know what i suffer. but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood. it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them. depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. her mind was less difficult to develop. she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper. when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news. chapter 2 bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on bingley. he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope bingley will like it lizzy. we are not in a way to know what bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit. but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that long has promised to introduce h i do not believe long will do any such thing. she has two nieces of her own. she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her. no more have i said bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you. bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters. dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces. kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill. i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully. when is your next ball to be lizzy to-morrow fortnight. aye so it is cried her mother and long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself. then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce bingley to her. impossible bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing i honour your circumspection. a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself. the girls stared at their father. bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he. do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there. what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts. mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how. while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to bingley. i am sick of bingley cried his wife. i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would no have called on him. it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now. the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. how good it was in you my dear bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning an never said a word about it till now. now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife. what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut. i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter. at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do anything. lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say bingley will dance with you at the next ball. oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest. the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner. chapter 3 not all that bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of bingley. they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been delighted with him. he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of bingleys heart were entertained. if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for. in a few days bingley returned bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc. bennet was quite disconcerted. she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. what a contrast between him and his friend darcy danced only once with hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party. his character was decided. he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. amongst the most violent against him was bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it. come darcy said he i must have you dance. i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better dance. i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with. i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty. you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet. oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you. which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me a am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me. bingley followed his advice. darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous. the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party. bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt janes pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants. they found bennet still up. with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different stor to hear. oh my dear bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there. jane was so admired nothing could be like it. everybody said how well she looked and bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice. only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. first of all he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance. so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next. then the two third he danced wit miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger— if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners. oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance oh my dear continued bennet i am quite delighted with handsome and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the lace upon hursts gown— here she was interrupted again. bennet protested against any description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of darcy. but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man. chapter 4 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good-humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners—so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete. i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i did not expect such a compliment. did not you i did for you. but that is one great difference between us. compliments always take you by surprise and me never. what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a stupider person. dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general. you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life. i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think. i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder. with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. and so you like this mans sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his. certainly not at first. but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her. elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them. they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited. they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it. bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase. his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house. he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately. between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion. in understanding darcy was the superior. bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence. the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had be most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. chapter 5 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st. jamess had made him courteous. lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to bennet. they had several children. the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty-seven was elizabeths intimate friend. that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate. you began the evening well charlotte said bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas. you were bingleys first choice. yes but he seemed to like his second better. oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice. to be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed i rather believe he did—i heard something about it—but i hardly know what—something about robinson. perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and robinson did not i mention it to you robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question—‘oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point. upon my word well that was very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but however it may all come to nothing you know. my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he—poor eliza—to be only just tolerable. i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his ill-treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips. are you quite sure maam—is not there a little mistake said jane. i certainly saw darcy speaking to her. aye—because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to. miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. with them he is remarkably agreeable. i do not believe a word of it my dear. if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to long. but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise. i do not mind his not talking to long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza. another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you. i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him. his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself. if i may so express it he has a right to be proud. that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine. pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe. by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously. a person may be proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us. if i were as rich as darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day. then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly. the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit. chapter 6 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit was returned in due form. miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration. it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding t the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas. it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affectio than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on. but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow. if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too. remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do. but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out. perhaps he must if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses. your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it. but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design. as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. she has know him only a fortnight. she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite enough to make her understand his character. not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal. yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded. well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to-morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life. you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound. you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself. occupied in observing bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise. but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness. of this she was perfectly unaware—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others. his doing so drew her notice. it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled. what does darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which darcy only can answer. but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about. he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him. on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic. you are severe on us. it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas. i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows. you are a very strange creature by way of a friend—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must. and gravely glancing at darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with—‘keep your breath to cool your porridge—and i shall keep mine to swell my song. her performance was pleasing though by no means capital. after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display. mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began. what a charming amusement for young people this is darcy there is nothing like dancing after all. i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies. certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.—every savage can dance. sir william only smiled. your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself darcy. you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir. yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do you often dance at st. jamess never sir. do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it. you have a house in town i conclude darcy bowed. i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas. he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you. and taking her hand he would have given it to darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner. darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain. elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half-hour. darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling. he is indeed—but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly and turned away. her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie. i should imagine not. you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion. i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you. my mind was more agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow. miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet. miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley. i am all astonishment. how long has she been such a favourite—and pray when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy. nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter absolutely settled. you will have a charming mother-in-law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you. he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long. chapter 7 bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds. she had a sister married to a phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade. the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters. their visits to philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections. their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves. philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers and bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced. catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london. i am astonished my dear said bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own however. if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it. yes—but as it happens they are all of them very clever. this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree. i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish. my dear bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well—and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals. mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer. bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love. it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud. my dear friend— if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—yours ever caroline bingley with the officers cried lydia. i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that. dining out said bennet that is very unlucky. can i have the carriage said jane. no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night. that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. oh but the gentlemen will have bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs. i had much rather go in the coach. but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure. they are wanted in the farm bennet are not they they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them. but if you have got them to-day said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered. she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back. this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy— i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better. they insist on my seeing jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with me.—yours &c. well my dear said bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of bingley and under your orders. oh i am not at all afraid of her dying. people do not die of li trifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays there it is all very well. i would go and see her if i could have the carriage. elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative. she declared her resolution. how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there. i shall be very fit to see jane—which is all i want. is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed. i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles. i shall be back by dinner. i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required. we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia. elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together. if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes. in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and chapter i. down the rabbit-hole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late (when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural) but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house (which was very likely true.) down down down. would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud. i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think— (for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over) —yes thats about the right distance—but then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to (alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say.) presently she began again. i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think— (she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word) —but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know. please maam is this new zealand or australia (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it) and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere. down down down. there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again. dinahll miss me very much to-night i should think (dinah was the cat.) i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know. but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it. she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over. alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it. there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again. suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them. however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat-hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders. oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin. for you see so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it (which certainly was not here before said alice) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters. it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry. no ill look first she said and see whether its marked ‘poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later. however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice (it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart custard pine-apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast) she very soon finished it off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope. and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle. i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried. come theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it) and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants. well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * chapter ii. the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english) now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was good-bye feet (for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off). oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can—but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas. and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look alices right foot esq. hearthrug near the fender (with alices love). oh dear what nonsense im talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again. you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you (she might well say this) to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir— the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to-day and yesterday things went on just as usual. i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different. but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them. im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i and—oh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know. let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is—oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography. london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome—no thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for mabel ill try and say ‘how doth the little— and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do— how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘come up again dear i shall only look up and say ‘who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody else—but oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking. how can i have done that she thought. i must be growing small again. she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that it is as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water. her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself. (alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station.) however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out. i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer to-day. just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out-of-the-way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying. so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse (alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—o mouse) the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing. perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror. (for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) so she began again où est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings. i quite forgot you didnt like cats. not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice. would you like cats if you were me well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it. and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and shes such a capital one for catching mice—oh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not. we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail. as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. are you—are you fond—of—of dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright-eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things—i cant remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats and—oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale (with passion alice thought) and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs. it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures. alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore. chapter iii. a caucus-race and a long tale they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable. the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life. indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said. at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle. alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know. silence all round if you please ‘william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria— ugh said the lory with a shiver. i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak not i said the lory hastily. i thought you did said the mouse. —i proceed. ‘edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable— found what said the duck. found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what ‘it means. i know what ‘it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm. the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on ‘—found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown. williams conduct at first was moderate. but the insolence of his normans— how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke. as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry me at all. in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies— speak english said the eaglet. i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly. what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race. what is a caucus-race said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it. (and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it.) first it marked out a race-course in a sort of circle (the exact shape doesnt matter it said) and then all the party were placed along the course here and there. there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him) while the rest waited in silence. at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes. but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked. why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt water had not got into it) and handed them round as prizes. there was exactly one a-piece all round. but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse. of course the dodo replied very gravely. what else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice. only a thimble said alice sadly. hand it over here said the dodo. then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered. alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could. the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more. you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate—c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again. mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing. it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this— fury said to a mouse that he met in the house ‘let us both go to law i will prosecute you.—come ill take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do. said the mouse to the cur ‘such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath. ‘ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ‘ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death. you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely. what are you thinking of i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily. a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her. oh do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away. you insult me by talking such nonsense i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice. but youre so easily offended you know the mouse only growled in reply. please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker. what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly. youre enough to try the patience of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular. shed soon fetch it back and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the lory. alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat. and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night-air doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone. i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone. nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story. chapter iv. the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely. very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made. he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran. how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him his fan and gloves—that is if i can find them. as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w. rabbit engraved upon it. she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen ‘miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk ‘coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out. only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does. i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enough—i hope i shant grow any more—as it is i cant get out at the door—i do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head. still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens. what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy. it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—its rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy-tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write one—but im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here. but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that oh you foolish alice she answered herself. how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson-books and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen. mary ann mary ann said the voice. fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it. presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure. alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window. that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of the sort. next came an angry voice—the rabbits—pat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging for apples yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily. here come and help me out of this (sounds of more broken glass.) now tell me pat whats that in the window sure its an arm yer honour (he pronounced it arrum.) an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole window sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that. well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. what a number of cucumber-frames there must be thought alice. i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stay in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladder—why i hadnt to bring but one bills got the other—bill fetch it here lad—here put em up at this corner—no tie em together first—they dont reach half high enough yet—oh theyll do well enough dont be particular—here bill catch hold of this rope—will the roof bear—mind that loose slate—oh its coming down heads below (a loud crash)—now who did that—it was bill i fancy—whos to go down the chimney—nay i shant you do it—that i wont then—bills to go down—here bill the master says youre to go down the chimney oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself. shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldnt guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next. the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice along—catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices—hold up his head—brandy now—dont choke him—how was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it last came a little feeble squeaking voice (thats bill thought alice) well i hardly know—no more thank ye im better now—but im a deal too flustered to tell you—all i know is something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box and up i goes like a sky-rocket so you did old fellow said the others. we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the roof off. after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with. a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence. alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose. so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea-pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be the best plan. it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her. poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut. this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance. and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much if—if id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me see—how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. chapter v. advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice. who are you said the caterpillar. this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. alice replied rather shyly i—i hardly know sir just at present—at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then. what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly. explain yourself i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see. i dont see said the caterpillar. im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. it isnt said the caterpillar. well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day you know—and then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you not a bit said the caterpillar. well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me. you said the caterpillar contemptuously. who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first. why said the caterpillar. here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away. come back the caterpillar called after her. ive something important to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again. keep your temper said the caterpillar. is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could. no said the caterpillar. alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i used—and i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together cant remember what things said the caterpillar. well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice. repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar. alice folded her hands and began— you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head— do you think at your age it is right in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again. you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door— pray what is the reason of that in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment—one shilling the box— allow me to sell you a couple you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak— pray how did you manage to do it in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life. you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose— what made you so awfully clever i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick you down stairs that is not said right said the caterpillar. not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered. it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes. the caterpillar was the first to speak. what size do you want to be it asked. oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know. i dont know said the caterpillar. alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper. are you content now said the caterpillar. well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be. it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone. and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself. then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter. one side of what the other side of what thought alice to herself. of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight. alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question. however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. what can all that green stuff be said alice. and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent. she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings. serpent screamed the pigeon. im not a serpent said alice indignantly. let me alone serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them i havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice. ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents theres no pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished. as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning. and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent but im not a serpent i tell you said alice. im a—im a— well what are you said the pigeon. i can see youre trying to invent something i—im a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use denying it. i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know. i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say. this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont like them raw. well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest. alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual. come theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high. whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. chapter vi. pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess. an invitation from the queen to play croquet. the frog-footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen. an invitation for the duchess to play croquet. then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together. alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish-footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky. alice went timidly up to the door and knocked. theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons. first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you. and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. please then said alice how am i to get in there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us. for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know. he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil. but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. but at any rate he might answer questions.—how am i to get in she repeated aloud. i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow— at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. —or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened. how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone. are you to get in at all said the footman. thats the first question you know. it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so. its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue. its enough to drive one crazy the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations. i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days. but what am i to do said alice. anything you like said the footman and began whistling. oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in. the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. theres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing. there was certainly too much of it in the air. even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause. the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why. pig she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again— i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin. they all can said the duchess and most of em do. i dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact. alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes. the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror. oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off. if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does. which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis— talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty-four hours i think or is it twelve i— oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases. chorus. (in which the cook and the baby joined) wow wow wow while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words— i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases chorus. wow wow wow here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke. i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room. the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out but it just missed her. alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer-shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star-fish thought alice. the poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it. as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself) she carried it out into the open air. if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself. the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. there could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all. but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears. no there were no tears. if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you. mind now the poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted it was impossible to say which) and they went on for some while in silence. alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm. this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think. and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them— when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. the cat only grinned when it saw alice. it looked good-natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider. come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on. would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat. i dont much care where— said alice. then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat. —so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation. oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough. alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question. what sort of people live about here in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare. visit either you like theyre both mad. but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked. oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here. im mad. youre mad. how do you know im mad said alice. you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here. alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that youre mad to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad. you grant that i suppose so said alice. well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased. now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry. therefore im mad. i call it purring not growling said alice. call it what you like said the cat. do you play croquet with the queen to-day i should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yet. youll see me there said the cat and vanished. alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening. while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again. by-the-bye what became of the baby said the cat. id nearly forgotten to ask. it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way. i thought it would said the cat and vanished again. alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live. ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in march. as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree. did you say pig or fig said the cat. i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy. all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. well ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat its the most curious thing i ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead chapter vii. a mad tea-party there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head. very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind. the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming. theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone. alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea. i dont see any wine she remarked. there isnt any said the march hare. then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily. it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare. i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three. your hair wants cutting said the hatter. he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech. you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude. the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing-desk come we shall have some fun now thought alice. im glad theyve begun asking riddles.—i believe i can guess that she added aloud. do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare. exactly so said alice. then you should say what you mean the march hare went on. i do alice hastily replied at least—at least i mean what i say—thats the same thing you know. not the same thing a bit said the hatter. you might just as well say that ‘i see what i eat is the same thing as ‘i eat what i see you might just as well say added the march hare that ‘i like what i get is the same thing as ‘i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that ‘i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as ‘i sleep when i breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks which wasnt much. the hatter was the first to break the silence. what day of the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear. alice considered a little and then said the fourth. two days wrong sighed the hatter. i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare. it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied. yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the bread-knife. the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know. alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. what a funny watch she remarked. it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is why should it muttered the hatter. does your watch tell you what year it is of course not alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together. which is just the case with mine said the hatter. alice felt dreadfully puzzled. the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english. i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could. the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself. have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again. no i give it up alice replied whats the answer i havent the slightest idea said the hatter. nor i said the march hare. alice sighed wearily. i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers. if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it. its him. i dont know what you mean said alice. of course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously. i dare say you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music. ah that accounts for it said the hatter. he wont stand beating. now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock. for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling half-past one time for dinner (i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper.) that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then—i shouldnt be hungry for it you know. not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked. is that the way you manage alice asked. the hatter shook his head mournfully. not i he replied. we quarrelled last march—just before he went mad you know— (pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare) —it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing ‘twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre at you know the song perhaps ive heard something like it said alice. it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way— ‘up above the world you fly like a tea-tray in the sky. twinkle twinkle— here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle— and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop. well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out ‘hes murdering the time off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice. and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now. a bright idea came into alices head. is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here she asked. yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always tea-time and weve no time to wash the things between whiles. then you keep moving round i suppose said alice. exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up. but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask. suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning. im getting tired of this. i vote the young lady tells us a story. im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal. then the dormouse shall they both cried. wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once. the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying. tell us a story said the march hare. yes please do pleaded alice. and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done. once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well— what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two. they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill. so they were said the dormouse very ill. alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly. ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take more. you mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothing. nobody asked your opinion said alice. whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly. alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question. why did they live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle-well. theres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself. no please go on alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again. i dare say there may be one. one indeed said the dormouse indignantly. however he consented to go on. and so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw you know— what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise. treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time. i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place on. he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare. the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate. alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i dont understand. where did they draw the treacle from you can draw water out of a water-well said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh stupid but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark. of course they were said the dormouse —well in. this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it. they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an m— why with an m said alice. why not said the march hare. alice was silent. the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on —that begins with an m such as mouse-traps and the moon and memory and muchness—you know you say things are much of a muchness—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont think— then you shouldnt talk said the hatter. this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot. at any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood. its the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. thats very curious she thought. but everythings curious today. i think i may as well go in at once. and in she went. once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table. now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden. then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. chapter viii. the queens croquet-ground a large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red. alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow. on which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the blame on others youd better not talk said five. i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first. thats none of your business two said seven. yes it is his business said five and ill tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions. seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things— when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low. would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses five and seven said nothing but looked at two. two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose-tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know. so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to— at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen. first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did. after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts. next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts. alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited. when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply. idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on whats your name child my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all. i neednt be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children. how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage. its no business of mine. the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off— nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent. the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so very carefully with one foot. get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else. leave off that screamed the queen. you make me giddy. and then turning to the rose-tree she went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying— i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses. off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection. you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others. are their heads off shouted the queen. their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted in reply. thats right shouted the queen. can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her. yes shouted alice. come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next. its—its a very fine day said a timid voice at her side. she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face. very said alice —wheres the duchess hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone. he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of execution. what for said alice. did you say ‘what a pity the rabbit asked. no i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity. i said ‘what for she boxed the queens ears— the rabbit began. alice gave a little scream of laughter. oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen said— get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began. alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches. the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute. alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to. how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with. alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded. its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them. in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared. i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speak—and they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them—and youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice. not at all said alice shes so extremely— just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on —likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game. the queen smiled and passed on. who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosity. its a friend of mine—a cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it. i dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes. id rather not the cat remarked. dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that he got behind alice as he spoke. a cat may look at a king said alice. ive read that in some book but i dont remember where. well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would have this cat removed the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small. off with his head she said without even looking round. ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off. alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion. she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. so she went in search of her hedgehog. the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground. so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable. the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life. the kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense. the queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round. (it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it. shes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here. and the executioner went off like an arrow. the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game. chapter ix. the mock turtles story you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together. alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. when im a duchess she said to herself (not in a very hopeful tone though) i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all. soup does very well without—maybe its always pepper that makes people hot-tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know— she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk. i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit. perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark. tut tut child said the duchess. everythings got a moral if only you can find it. and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke. alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could. the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little. tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is—‘oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that is—‘take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves. how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself. i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. shall i try the experiment he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite. and the moral of that is—‘birds of a feather flock together. only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked. right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things its a mineral i think said alice. of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustard-mine near here. and the moral of that is—‘the more there is of mine the less there is of yours. oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable. it doesnt look like one but it is. i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is—‘be what you would seem to be—or if youd like it put more simply—‘never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise. i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it. thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone. pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice. oh dont talk about trouble said the duchess. i make you a present of everything ive said as yet. a cheap sort of present thought alice. im glad they dont give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out loud. thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin. ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried. just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m— but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm. a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice. now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment. lets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives. all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution. then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet no said alice. i dont even know what a mock turtle is. its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen. i never saw one or heard of one said alice. come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned. come thats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered. they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun. (if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture.) up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history. i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon. alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited. the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled. what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice. what is the fun said alice. why she said the gryphon. its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know. come on everybody says ‘come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. she pitied him deeply. what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know. come on so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing. this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do. ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished. so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to herself i dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin. but she waited patiently. once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle. these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing. when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea. the master was an old turtle—we used to call him tortoise— why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice asked. we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth. at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it— i never said i didnt interrupted alice. you did said the mock turtle. hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again. the mock turtle went on. we had the best of educations—in fact we went to school every day— ive been to a day-school too said alice you neednt be so proud as all that. with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously. yes said alice we learned french and music. and washing said the mock turtle. certainly not said alice indignantly. ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief. now at ours they had at the end of the bill ‘french music and washing—extra. you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea. i couldnt afford to learn it. said the mock turtle with a sigh. i only took the regular course. what was that inquired alice. reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic—ambition distraction uglification and derision. i never heard of ‘uglification alice ventured to say. what is it the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. what never heard of uglifying it exclaimed. you know what to beautify is i suppose yes said alice doubtfully it means—to—make—anything—prettier. well then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton. alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers —mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling—the drawling-master was an old conger-eel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils. what was that like said alice. well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too stiff. and the gryphon never learnt it. hadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though. he was an old crab he was. i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say. so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject. ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on. what a curious plan exclaimed alice. thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day. this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. then the eleventh day must have been a holiday of course it was said the mock turtle. and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly. thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now. chapter x. the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again— you may not have lived much under the sea— (i havent said alice)—and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster— (alice began to say i once tasted— but checked herself hastily and said no never) —so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is no indeed said alice. what sort of a dance is it why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea-shore— two lines cried the mock turtle. seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way— that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon. —you advance twice— each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon. of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners— —change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon. then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the— the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air. —as far out to sea as you can— swim after them screamed the gryphon. turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about. change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice. back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice. it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly. would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle. very much indeed said alice. come lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon. we can do without lobsters you know. which shall sing oh you sing said the gryphon. ive forgotten the words. so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly— will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail. theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail. see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance— said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance. would not could not would not could not would not join the dance. would not could not would not could not could not join the dance. what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied. there is another shore you know upon the other side. the further off from england the nearer is to france— then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance. will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they—youve seen them of course yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn— she checked herself hastily. i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like. i believe so alice replied thoughtfully. they have their tails in their mouths—and theyre all over crumbs. youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea. but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is— here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon. the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. so they got thrown out to sea. so they had to fall a long way. so they got their tails fast in their mouths. so they couldnt get them out again. thats all. thank you said alice its very interesting. i never knew so much about a whiting before. i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon. do you know why its called a whiting i never thought about it said alice. why it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly. alice was thoroughly puzzled. does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone. why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon. i mean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer. theyre done with blacking i believe. boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting. now you know. and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that. if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise ‘keep back please we dont want you with us they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise. wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise. of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say ‘with what porpoise dont you mean ‘purpose said alice. i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone. and the gryphon added come lets hear some of your adventures. i could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then. explain all that said the mock turtle. no no the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time. so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit. she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curious. its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon. it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully. i should like to hear her try and repeat something now. tell her to begin. he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice. stand up and repeat ‘tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon. how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once. however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed— tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair. as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes. [later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon. well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense. alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again. i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle. she cant explain it said the gryphon hastily. go on with the next verse. but about his toes the mock turtle persisted. how could he turn them out with his nose you know its the first position in dancing. alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject. go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins ‘i passed by his garden. alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice— i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie— [later editions continued as follows the panther took pie-crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat. when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet—] what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far the most confusing thing i ever heard yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so. shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on. or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her ‘turtle soup will you old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this— beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup beau—ootiful soo—oop beau—ootiful soo—oop soo—oop of the e—e—evening beautiful beautiful soup beautiful soup who cares for fish game or any other dish who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup beau—ootiful soo—oop beau—ootiful soo—oop soo—oop of the e—e—evening beautiful beauti—ful soup chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the distance. come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song. what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words— soo—oop of the e—e—evening beautiful beautiful soup chapter xi. who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them—i wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time. alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig. the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it) he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming. and thats the jury-box thought alice and those twelve creatures (she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds) i suppose they are the jurors. she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. however jury-men would have done just as well. the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon. they cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun. theyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial. stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking. alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought alice. one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. she did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was bill the lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate. herald read the accusation said the king. on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows— the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away consider your verdict the king said to the jury. not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted. theres a great deal to come before that call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for. you ought to have finished said the king. when did you begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm-in-arm with the dormouse. fourteenth of march i think it was he said. fifteenth said the march hare. sixteenth added the dormouse. write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. take off your hat the king said to the hatter. it isnt mine said the hatter. stolen the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own. im a hatter. here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted. give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spot. this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. i wish you wouldnt squeeze so. said the dormouse who was sitting next to her. i can hardly breathe. i cant help it said alice very meekly im growing. youve no right to grow here said the dormouse. dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know youre growing too. yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion. and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off. give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed whether youre nervous or not. im a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice —and i hadnt begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea— the twinkling of the what said the king. it began with the tea the hatter replied. of course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply. do you take me for a dunce go on im a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that—only the march hare said— i didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry. you did said the hatter. i deny it said the march hare. he denies it said the king leave out that part. well at any rate the dormouse said— the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep. after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread-and-butter— but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked. that i cant remember said the hatter. you must remember remarked the king or ill have you executed. the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter and went down on one knee. im a poor man your majesty he began. youre a very poor speaker said the king. here one of the guinea-pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done. they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea-pig head first and then sat upon it.) im glad ive seen that done thought alice. ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now. if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king. i cant go no lower said the hatter im on the floor as it is. then you may sit down the king replied. here the other guinea-pig cheered and was suppressed. come that finished the guinea-pigs thought alice. now we shall get on better. id rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers. you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on. —and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. call the next witness said the king. the next witness was the duchesss cook. she carried the pepper-box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. give your evidence said the king. shant said the cook. the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross-examine this witness. well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook. treacle said a sleepy voice behind her. collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out. behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his whiskers for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared. never mind said the king with an air of great relief. call the next witness. and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross-examine the next witness. it quite makes my forehead ache alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like —for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself. imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice chapter xii. alices evidence here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box or they would die. the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said so. alice looked at the jury-box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move. she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other. as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court. what do you know about this business the king said to alice. nothing said alice. nothing whatever persisted the king. nothing whatever said alice. thats very important the king said turning to the jury. they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone important—unimportant—unimportant—important— as if he were trying which word sounded best. some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant. alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself. at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book cackled out silence and read out from his book rule forty-two. all persons more than a mile high to leave the court. everybody looked at alice. im not a mile high said alice. you are said the king. nearly two miles high added the queen. well i shant go at any rate said alice besides thats not a regular rule you invented it just now. its the oldest rule in the book said the king. then it ought to be number one said alice. the king turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice. theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up. whats in it said the queen. i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to—to somebody. it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know. who is it directed to said one of the jurymen. it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside. he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a set of verses. are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen. no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it. (the jury all looked puzzled.) he must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king. (the jury all brightened up again.) please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they cant prove i did theres no name signed at the end. if you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse. you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man. there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day. that proves his guilt said the queen. it proves nothing of the sort said alice. why you dont even know what theyre about read them said the king. the white rabbit put on his spectacles. where shall i begin please your majesty he asked. begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop. these were the verses the white rabbit read— they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim. he sent them word i had not gone (we know it to be true) if she should push the matter on what would become of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before. if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were. my notion was that you had been (before she had this fit) an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it. dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me. thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury— if any one of them can explain it said alice (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him) ill give him sixpence. i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it. the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper. if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any. and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all. —said i could not swim— you cant swim can you he added turning to the knave. the knave shook his head sadly. do i look like it he said. (which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard.) all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself ‘we know it to be true— thats the jury of course—‘i gave her one they gave him two— why that must be what he did with the tarts you know— but it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you said alice. why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table. nothing can be clearer than that. then again—‘before she had this fit— you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queen. never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke. (the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted.) then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile. there was a dead silence. its a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day. no no said the queen. sentence first—verdict afterwards. stuff and nonsense said alice loudly. the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the queen turning purple. i wont said alice. off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice. nobody moved. who cares for you said alice (she had grown to her full size by this time.) youre nothing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. wake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep youve had oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late. so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been. but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream— first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream. the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by—the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slate-pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle. so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs. lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after-time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included. thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility www.gutenberg.org this website includes information about project gutenberg-tm including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks. the artist is the creator of beautiful things. to reveal art and conceal the artist is arts aim. the critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things. the highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. this is a fault. those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. for these there is hope. they are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty. there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. books are well written or badly written. that is all. the nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of caliban seeing his own face in a glass. the nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. the moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. no artist desires to prove anything. even things that are true can be proved. no artist has ethical sympathies. an ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. no artist is ever morbid. the artist can express everything. thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. from the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. from the point of view of feeling the actors craft is the type. all art is at once surface and symbol. those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. those who read the symbol do so at their peril. it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors. diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new complex and vital. when critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. we can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. the only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. all art is quite useless. oscar wilde chapter i. the studio was filled with the rich odour of roses and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn. from the corner of the divan of persian saddle-bags on which he was lying smoking as was his custom innumerable cigarettes lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window producing a kind of momentary japanese effect and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of tokyo who through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. the sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ. in the centre of the room clamped to an upright easel stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty and in front of it some little distance away was sitting the artist himself basil hallward whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused at the time such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures. as the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art a smile of pleasure passed across his face and seemed about to linger there. but he suddenly started up and closing his eyes placed his fingers upon the lids as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake. it is your best work basil the best thing you have ever done said lord henry languidly. you must certainly send it next year to the grosvenor. the academy is too large and too vulgar. whenever i have gone there there have been either so many people that i have not been able to see the pictures which was dreadful or so many pictures that i have not been able to see the people which was worse. the grosvenor is really the only place. i dont think i shall send it anywhere he answered tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at oxford. no i wont send it anywhere. lord henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette. not send it anywhere my dear fellow why have you any reason what odd chaps you painters are you do anything in the world to gain a reputation. as soon as you have one you seem to want to throw it away. it is silly of you for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about. a portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in england and make the old men quite jealous if old men are ever capable of any emotion. i know you will laugh at me he replied but i really cant exhibit it. i have put too much of myself into it. lord henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. yes i knew you would but it is quite true all the same. too much of yourself in it upon my word basil i didnt know you were so vain and i really cant see any resemblance between you with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair and this young adonis who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. why my dear basil he is a narcissus and you—well of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. but beauty real beauty ends where an intellectual expression begins. intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face. the moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid. look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. how perfectly hideous they are except of course in the church. but then in the church they dont think. a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. your mysterious young friend whose name you have never told me but whose picture really fascinates me never thinks. i feel quite sure of that. he is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. dont flatter yourself basil you are not in the least like him. you dont understand me harry answered the artist. of course i am not like him. i know that perfectly well. indeed i should be sorry to look like him. you shrug your shoulders i am telling you the truth. there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. it is better not to be different from ones fellows. the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. they can sit at their ease and gape at the play. if they know nothing of victory they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. they live as we all should live—undisturbed indifferent and without disquiet. they neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien hands. your rank and wealth harry my brains such as they are—my art whatever it may be worth dorian grays good looks—we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us suffer terribly. dorian gray is that his name asked lord henry walking across the studio towards basil hallward. yes that is his name. i didnt intend to tell it to you. but why not oh i cant explain. when i like people immensely i never tell their names to any one. it is like surrendering a part of them. i have grown to love secrecy. it seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. the commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. when i leave town now i never tell my people where i am going. if i did i would lose all my pleasure. it is a silly habit i dare say but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into ones life. i suppose you think me awfully foolish about it not at all answered lord henry not at all my dear basil. you seem to forget that i am married and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. i never know where my wife is and my wife never knows what i am doing. when we meet—we do meet occasionally when we dine out together or go down to the dukes—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces. my wife is very good at it—much better in fact than i am. she never gets confused over her dates and i always do. but when she does find me out she makes no row at all. i sometimes wish she would but she merely laughs at me. i hate the way you talk about your married life harry said basil hallward strolling towards the door that led into the garden. i believe that you are really a very good husband but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. you are an extraordinary fellow. you never say a moral thing and you never do a wrong thing. your cynicism is simply a pose. being natural is simply a pose and the most irritating pose i know cried lord henry laughing and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. the sunlight slipped over the polished leaves. in the grass white daisies were tremulous. after a pause lord henry pulled out his watch. i am afraid i must be going basil he murmured and before i go i insist on your answering a question i put to you some time ago. what is that said the painter keeping his eyes fixed on the ground. you know quite well. i do not harry. well i will tell you what it is. i want you to explain to me why you wont exhibit dorian grays picture. i want the real reason. i told you the real reason. no you did not. you said it was because there was too much of yourself in it. now that is childish. harry said basil hallward looking him straight in the face every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist not of the sitter. the sitter is merely the accident the occasion. it is not he who is revealed by the painter it is rather the painter who on the coloured canvas reveals himself. the reason i will not exhibit this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my own soul. lord henry laughed. and what is that he asked. i will tell you said hallward but an expression of perplexity came over his face. i am all expectation basil continued his companion glancing at him. oh there is really very little to tell harry answered the painter and i am afraid you will hardly understand it. perhaps you will hardly believe it. lord henry smiled and leaning down plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it. i am quite sure i shall understand it he replied gazing intently at the little golden white-feathered disk and as for believing things i can believe anything provided that it is quite incredible. the wind shook some blossoms from the trees and the heavy lilac-blooms with their clustering stars moved to and fro in the languid air. a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings. lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallwards heart beating and wondered what was coming. the story is simply this said the painter after some time. two months ago i went to a crush at lady brandons. you know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time just to remind the public that we are not savages. with an evening coat and a white tie as you told me once anybody even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized. well after i had been in the room about ten minutes talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians i suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me. i turned half-way round and saw dorian gray for the first time. when our eyes met i felt that i was growing pale. a curious sensation of terror came over me. i knew that i had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that if i allowed it to do so it would absorb my whole nature my whole soul my very art itself. i did not want any external influence in my life. you know yourself harry how independent i am by nature. i have always been my own master had at least always been so till i met dorian gray. then—but i dont know how to explain it to you. something seemed to tell me that i was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. i had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. i grew afraid and turned to quit the room. it was not conscience that made me do so it was a sort of cowardice. i take no credit to myself for trying to escape. conscience and cowardice are really the same things basil. conscience is the trade-name of the firm. that is all. i dont believe that harry and i dont believe you do either. however whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride for i used to be very proud—i certainly struggled to the door. there of course i stumbled against lady brandon. ‘you are not going to run away so soon hallward she screamed out. you know her curiously shrill voice yes she is a peacock in everything but beauty said lord henry pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers. i could not get rid of her. she brought me up to royalties and people with stars and garters and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses. she spoke of me as her dearest friend. i had only met her once before but she took it into her head to lionize me. i believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality. suddenly i found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me. we were quite close almost touching. our eyes met again. it was reckless of me but i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him. perhaps it was not so reckless after all. it was simply inevitable. we would have spoken to each other without any introduction. i am sure of that. dorian told me so afterwards. he too felt that we were destined to know each other. and how did lady brandon describe this wonderful young man asked his companion. i know she goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests. i remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons and hissing into my ear in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room the most astounding details. i simply fled. i like to find out people for myself. but lady brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. she either explains them entirely away or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know. poor lady brandon you are hard on her harry said hallward listlessly. my dear fellow she tried to found a salon and only succeeded in opening a restaurant. how could i admire her but tell me what did she say about dorian gray oh something like ‘charming boy—poor dear mother and i absolutely inseparable. quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesnt do anything—oh yes plays the piano—or is it the violin dear gray neither of us could help laughing and we became friends at once. laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and it is far the best ending for one said the young lord plucking another daisy. hallward shook his head. you dont understand what friendship is harry he murmured—or what enmity is for that matter. you like every one that is to say you are indifferent to every one. how horribly unjust of you cried lord henry tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky. yes horribly unjust of you. i make a great difference between people. i choose my friends for their good looks my acquaintances for their good characters and my enemies for their good intellects. a man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. i have not got one who is a fool. they are all men of some intellectual power and consequently they all appreciate me. is that very vain of me i think it is rather vain. i should think it was harry. but according to your category i must be merely an acquaintance. my dear old basil you are much more than an acquaintance. and much less than a friend. a sort of brother i suppose oh brothers i dont care for brothers. my elder brother wont die and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else. harry exclaimed hallward frowning. my dear fellow i am not quite serious. but i cant help detesting my relations. i suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. i quite sympathize with the rage of the english democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders. the masses feel that drunkenness stupidity and immorality should be their own special property and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves. when poor southwark got into the divorce court their indignation was quite magnificent. and yet i dont suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly. i dont agree with a single word that you have said and what is more harry i feel sure you dont either. lord henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. how english you are basil that is the second time you have made that observation. if one puts forward an idea to a true englishman—always a rash thing to do—he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. the only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. now the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. indeed the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is the more purely intellectual will the idea be as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants his desires or his prejudices. however i dont propose to discuss politics sociology or metaphysics with you. i like persons better than principles and i like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. tell me more about dorian gray. how often do you see him every day. i couldnt be happy if i didnt see him every day. he is absolutely necessary to me. how extraordinary i thought you would never care for anything but your art. he is all my art to me now said the painter gravely. i sometimes think harry that there are only two eras of any importance in the worlds history. the first is the appearance of a new medium for art and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. what the invention of oil-painting was to the venetians the face of antinous was to late greek sculpture and the face of dorian gray will some day be to me. it is not merely that i paint from him draw from him sketch from him. of course i have done all that. but he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. i wont tell you that i am dissatisfied with what i have done of him or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. there is nothing that art cannot express and i know that the work i have done since i met dorian gray is good work is the best work of my life. but in some curious way—i wonder will you understand me—his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art an entirely new mode of style. i see things differently i think of them differently. i can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. ‘a dream of form in days of thought—who is it who says that i forget but it is what dorian gray has been to me. the merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to me little more than a lad though he is really over twenty—his merely visible presence—ah i wonder can you realize all that that means unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit all the perfection of the spirit that is greek. the harmony of soul and body—how much that is we in our madness have separated the two and have invented a realism that is vulgar an ideality that is void. harry if you only knew what dorian gray is to me you remember that landscape of mine for which agnew offered me such a huge price but which i would not part with it is one of the best things i have ever done. and why is it so because while i was painting it dorian gray sat beside me. some subtle influence passed from him to me and for the first time in my life i saw in the plain woodland the wonder i had always looked for and always missed. basil this is extraordinary i must see dorian gray. hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. after some time he came back. harry he said dorian gray is to me simply a motive in art. you might see nothing in him. i see everything in him. he is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there. he is a suggestion as i have said of a new manner. i find him in the curves of certain lines in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. that is all. then why wont you exhibit his portrait asked lord henry. because without intending it i have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry of which of course i have never cared to speak to him. he knows nothing about it. he shall never know anything about it. but the world might guess it and i will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. my heart shall never be put under their microscope. there is too much of myself in the thing harry—too much of myself poets are not so scrupulous as you are. they know how useful passion is for publication. nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions. i hate them for it cried hallward. an artist should create beautiful things but should put nothing of his own life into them. we live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. we have lost the abstract sense of beauty. some day i will show the world what it is and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of dorian gray. i think you are wrong basil but i wont argue with you. it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue. tell me is dorian gray very fond of you the painter considered for a few moments. he likes me he answered after a pause i know he likes me. of course i flatter him dreadfully. i find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that i know i shall be sorry for having said. as a rule he is charming to me and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. now and then however he is horribly thoughtless and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. then i feel harry that i have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat a bit of decoration to charm his vanity an ornament for a summers day. days in summer basil are apt to linger murmured lord henry. perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. it is a sad thing to think of but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. in the wild struggle for existence we want to have something that endures and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts in the silly hope of keeping our place. the thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. and the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. it is like a bric-à-brac shop all monsters and dust with everything priced above its proper value. i think you will tire first all the same. some day you will look at your friend and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing or you wont like his tone of colour or something. you will bitterly reproach him in your own heart and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. the next time he calls you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. it will be a great pity for it will alter you. what you have told me is quite a romance a romance of art one might call it and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic. harry dont talk like that. as long as i live the personality of dorian gray will dominate me. you cant feel what i feel. you change too often. ah my dear basil that is exactly why i can feel it. those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love it is the faithless who know loves tragedies. and lord henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. how pleasant it was in the garden and how delightful other peoples emotions were—much more delightful than their ideas it seemed to him. ones own soul and the passions of ones friends—those were the fascinating things in life. he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward. had he gone to his aunts he would have been sure to have met lord goodbody there and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses. each class would have preached the importance of those virtues for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. the rich would have spoken on the value of thrift and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. it was charming to have escaped all that as he thought of his aunt an idea seemed to strike him. he turned to hallward and said my dear fellow i have just remembered. remembered what harry where i heard the name of dorian gray. where was it asked hallward with a slight frown. dont look so angry basil. it was at my aunt lady agathas. she told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the east end and that his name was dorian gray. i am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. women have no appreciation of good looks at least good women have not. she said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature. i at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair horribly freckled and tramping about on huge feet. i wish i had known it was your friend. i am very glad you didnt harry. why i dont want you to meet him. you dont want me to meet him no. dorian gray is in the studio sir said the butler coming into the garden. you must introduce me now cried lord henry laughing. the painter turned to his servant who stood blinking in the sunlight. ask gray to wait parker i shall be in in a few moments. the man bowed and went up the walk. then he looked at lord henry. dorian gray is my dearest friend he said. he has a simple and a beautiful nature. your aunt was quite right in what she said of him. dont spoil him. dont try to influence him. your influence would be bad. the world is wide and has many marvellous people in it. dont take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses my life as an artist depends on him. mind harry i trust you. he spoke very slowly and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will. what nonsense you talk said lord henry smiling and taking hallward by the arm he almost led him into the house. chapter ii. as they entered they saw dorian gray. he was seated at the piano with his back to them turning over the pages of a volume of schumanns forest scenes. you must lend me these basil he cried. i want to learn them. they are perfectly charming. that entirely depends on how you sit to-day dorian. oh i am tired of sitting and i dont want a life-sized portrait of myself answered the lad swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful petulant manner. when he caught sight of lord henry a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment and he started up. i beg your pardon basil but i didnt know you had any one with you. this is lord henry wotton dorian an old oxford friend of mine. i have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were and now you have spoiled everything. you have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you gray said lord henry stepping forward and extending his hand. my aunt has often spoken to me about you. you are one of her favourites and i am afraid one of her victims also. i am in lady agathas black books at present answered dorian with a funny look of penitence. i promised to go to a club in whitechapel with her last tuesday and i really forgot all about it. we were to have played a duet together—three duets i believe. i dont know what she will say to me. i am far too frightened to call. oh i will make your peace with my aunt. she is quite devoted to you. and i dont think it really matters about your not being there. the audience probably thought it was a duet. when aunt agatha sits down to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people. that is very horrid to her and not very nice to me answered dorian laughing. lord henry looked at him. yes he was certainly wonderfully handsome with his finely curved scarlet lips his frank blue eyes his crisp gold hair. there was something in his face that made one trust him at once. all the candour of youth was there as well as all youths passionate purity. one felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world. no wonder basil hallward worshipped him. you are too charming to go in for philanthropy gray—far too charming. and lord henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case. the painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready. he was looking worried and when he heard lord henrys last remark he glanced at him hesitated for a moment and then said harry i want to finish this picture to-day. would you think it awfully rude of me if i asked you to go away lord henry smiled and looked at dorian gray. am i to go gray he asked. oh please dont lord henry. i see that basil is in one of his sulky moods and i cant bear him when he sulks. besides i want you to tell me why i should not go in for philanthropy. i dont know that i shall tell you that gray. it is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. but i certainly shall not run away now that you have asked me to stop. you dont really mind basil do you you have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to. hallward bit his lip. if dorian wishes it of course you must stay. dorians whims are laws to everybody except himself. lord henry took up his hat and gloves. you are very pressing basil but i am afraid i must go. i have promised to meet a man at the orleans. good-bye gray. come and see me some afternoon in curzon street. i am nearly always at home at five oclock. write to me when you are coming. i should be sorry to miss you. basil cried dorian gray if lord henry wotton goes i shall go too. you never open your lips while you are painting and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. ask him to stay. i insist upon it. stay harry to oblige dorian and to oblige me said hallward gazing intently at his picture. it is quite true i never talk when i am working and never listen either and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters. i beg you to stay. but what about my man at the orleans the painter laughed. i dont think there will be any difficulty about that. sit down again harry. and now dorian get up on the platform and dont move about too much or pay any attention to what lord henry says. he has a very bad influence over all his friends with the single exception of myself. dorian gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young greek martyr and made a little moue of discontent to lord henry to whom he had rather taken a fancy. he was so unlike basil. they made a delightful contrast. and he had such a beautiful voice. after a few moments he said to him have you really a very bad influence lord henry as bad as basil says there is no such thing as a good influence gray. all influence is immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view. why because to influence a person is to give him ones own soul. he does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passions. his virtues are not real to him. his sins if there are such things as sins are borrowed. he becomes an echo of some one elses music an actor of a part that has not been written for him. the aim of life is self-development. to realize ones nature perfectly—that is what each of us is here for. people are afraid of themselves nowadays. they have forgotten the highest of all duties the duty that one owes to ones self. of course they are charitable. they feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. but their own souls starve and are naked. courage has gone out of our race. perhaps we never really had it. the terror of society which is the basis of morals the terror of god which is the secret of religion—these are the two things that govern us. and yet— just turn your head a little more to the right dorian like a good boy said the painter deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lads face that he had never seen there before. and yet continued lord henry in his low musical voice and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him and that he had even in his eton days i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely were to give form to every feeling expression to every thought reality to every dream—i believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediævalism and return to the hellenic ideal—to something finer richer than the hellenic ideal it may be. but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. we are punished for our refusals. every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. the body sins once and has done with its sin for action is a mode of purification. nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure or the luxury of a regret. the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. it has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. it is in the brain and the brain only that the great sins of the world take place also. you gray you yourself with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood you have had passions that have made you afraid thoughts that have filled you with terror day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame— stop faltered dorian gray stop you bewilder me. i dont know what to say. there is some answer to you but i cannot find it. dont speak. let me think. or rather let me try not to think. for nearly ten minutes he stood there motionless with parted lips and eyes strangely bright. he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him. yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself. the few words that basils friend had said to him—words spoken by chance no doubt and with wilful paradox in them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses. music had stirred him like that. music had troubled him many times. but music was not articulate. it was not a new world but rather another chaos that it created in us. words mere words how terrible they were how clear and vivid and cruel one could not escape from them. and yet what a subtle magic there was in them they seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. mere words was there anything so real as words yes there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. he understood them now. life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. it seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. why had he not known it with his subtle smile lord henry watched him. he knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing. he felt intensely interested. he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced and remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before he wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience. he had merely shot an arrow into the air. had it hit the mark how fascinating the lad was hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art at any rate comes only from strength. he was unconscious of the silence. basil i am tired of standing cried dorian gray suddenly. i must go out and sit in the garden. the air is stifling here. my dear fellow i am so sorry. when i am painting i cant think of anything else. but you never sat better. you were perfectly still. and i have caught the effect i wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes. i dont know what harry has been saying to you but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. i suppose he has been paying you compliments. you mustnt believe a word that he says. he has certainly not been paying me compliments. perhaps that is the reason that i dont believe anything he has told me. you know you believe it all said lord henry looking at him with his dreamy languorous eyes. i will go out to the garden with you. it is horribly hot in the studio. basil let us have something iced to drink something with strawberries in it. certainly harry. just touch the bell and when parker comes i will tell him what you want. i have got to work up this background so i will join you later on. dont keep dorian too long. i have never been in better form for painting than i am to-day. this is going to be my masterpiece. it is my masterpiece as it stands. lord henry went out to the garden and found dorian gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine. he came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder. you are quite right to do that he murmured. nothing can cure the soul but the senses just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul. the lad started and drew back. he was bareheaded and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. there was a look of fear in his eyes such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. his finely chiselled nostrils quivered and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling. yes continued lord henry that is one of the great secrets of life—to cure the soul by means of the senses and the senses by means of the soul. you are a wonderful creation. you know more than you think you know just as you know less than you want to know. dorian gray frowned and turned his head away. he could not help liking the tall graceful young man who was standing by him. his romantic olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. his cool white flowerlike hands even had a curious charm. they moved as he spoke like music and seemed to have a language of their own. but he felt afraid of him and ashamed of being afraid. why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself he had known basil hallward for months but the friendship between them had never altered him. suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him lifes mystery. and yet what was there to be afraid of he was not a schoolboy or a girl. it was absurd to be frightened. let us go and sit in the shade said lord henry. parker has brought out the drinks and if you stay any longer in this glare you will be quite spoiled and basil will never paint you again. you really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt. it would be unbecoming. what can it matter cried dorian gray laughing as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden. it should matter everything to you gray. why because you have the most marvellous youth and youth is the one thing worth having. i dont feel that lord henry. no you dont feel it now. some day when you are old and wrinkled and ugly when thought has seared your forehead with its lines and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires you will feel it you will feel it terribly. now wherever you go you charm the world. will it always be so ... you have a wonderfully beautiful face gray. dont frown. you have. and beauty is a form of genius—is higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation. it is of the great facts of the world like sunlight or spring-time or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. it cannot be questioned. it has its divine right of sovereignty. it makes princes of those who have it. you smile ah when you have lost it you wont smile.... people say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. that may be so but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. to me beauty is the wonder of wonders. it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. the true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible.... yes gray the gods have been good to you. but what the gods give they quickly take away. you have only a few years in which to live really perfectly and fully. when your youth goes your beauty will go with it and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. time is jealous of you and wars against your lilies and your roses. you will become sallow and hollow-cheeked and dull-eyed. you will suffer horribly.... ah realize your youth while you have it. dont squander the gold of your days listening to the tedious trying to improve the hopeless failure or giving away your life to the ignorant the common and the vulgar. these are the sickly aims the false ideals of our age. live live the wonderful life that is in you let nothing be lost upon you. be always searching for new sensations. be afraid of nothing.... a new hedonism—that is what our century wants. you might be its visible symbol. with your personality there is nothing you could not do. the world belongs to you for a season.... the moment i met you i saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are of what you really might be. there was so much in you that charmed me that i felt i must tell you something about yourself. i thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. for there is such a little time that your youth will last—such a little time. the common hill-flowers wither but they blossom again. the laburnum will be as yellow next june as it is now. in a month there will be purple stars on the clematis and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. but we never get back our youth. the pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. our limbs fail our senses rot. we degenerate into hideous puppets haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. youth youth there is absolutely nothing in the world but youth dorian gray listened open-eyed and wondering. the spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. a furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment. then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. he watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. after a time the bee flew away. he saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a tyrian convolvulus. the flower seemed to quiver and then swayed gently to and fro. suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in. they turned to each other and smiled. i am waiting he cried. do come in. the light is quite perfect and you can bring your drinks. they rose up and sauntered down the walk together. two green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them and in the pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing. you are glad you have met me gray said lord henry looking at him. yes i am glad now. i wonder shall i always be glad always that is a dreadful word. it makes me shudder when i hear it. women are so fond of using it. they spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. it is a meaningless word too. the only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer. as they entered the studio dorian gray put his hand upon lord henrys arm. in that case let our friendship be a caprice he murmured flushing at his own boldness then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose. lord henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him. the sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness except when now and then hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance. in the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. the heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything. after about a quarter of an hour hallward stopped painting looked for a long time at dorian gray and then for a long time at the picture biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. it is quite finished he cried at last and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas. lord henry came over and examined the picture. it was certainly a wonderful work of art and a wonderful likeness as well. my dear fellow i congratulate you most warmly he said. it is the finest portrait of modern times. gray come over and look at yourself. the lad started as if awakened from some dream. is it really finished he murmured stepping down from the platform. quite finished said the painter. and you have sat splendidly to-day. i am awfully obliged to you. that is entirely due to me broke in lord henry. isnt it gray dorian made no answer but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. when he saw it he drew back and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. a look of joy came into his eyes as if he had recognized himself for the first time. he stood there motionless and in wonder dimly conscious that hallward was speaking to him but not catching the meaning of his words. the sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. he had never felt it before. basil hallwards compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship. he had listened to them laughed at them forgotten them. they had not influenced his nature. then had come lord henry wotton with his strange panegyric on youth his terrible warning of its brevity. that had stirred him at the time and now as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness the full reality of the description flashed across him. yes there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen his eyes dim and colourless the grace of his figure broken and deformed. the scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. the life that was to make his soul would mar his body. he would become dreadful hideous and uncouth. as he thought of it a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. his eyes deepened into amethyst and across them came a mist of tears. he felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart. dont you like it cried hallward at last stung a little by the lads silence not understanding what it meant. of course he likes it said lord henry. who wouldnt like it it is one of the greatest things in modern art. i will give you anything you like to ask for it. i must have it. it is not my property harry. whose property is it dorians of course answered the painter. he is a very lucky fellow. how sad it is murmured dorian gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait. how sad it is i shall grow old and horrible and dreadful. but this picture will remain always young. it will never be older than this particular day of june.... if it were only the other way if it were i who was to be always young and the picture that was to grow old for that—for that—i would give everything yes there is nothing in the whole world i would not give i would give my soul for that you would hardly care for such an arrangement basil cried lord henry laughing. it would be rather hard lines on your work. i should object very strongly harry said hallward. dorian gray turned and looked at him. i believe you would basil. you like your art better than your friends. i am no more to you than a green bronze figure. hardly as much i dare say. the painter stared in amazement. it was so unlike dorian to speak like that. what had happened he seemed quite angry. his face was flushed and his cheeks burning. yes he continued i am less to you than your ivory hermes or your silver faun. you will like them always. how long will you like me till i have my first wrinkle i suppose. i know now that when one loses ones good looks whatever they may be one loses everything. your picture has taught me that. lord henry wotton is perfectly right. youth is the only thing worth having. when i find that i am growing old i shall kill myself. hallward turned pale and caught his hand. dorian dorian he cried dont talk like that. i have never had such a friend as you and i shall never have such another. you are not jealous of material things are you—you who are finer than any of them i am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. i am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. why should it keep what i must lose every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it. oh if it were only the other way if the picture could change and i could be always what i am now why did you paint it it will mock me some day—mock me horribly the hot tears welled into his eyes he tore his hand away and flinging himself on the divan he buried his face in the cushions as though he was praying. this is your doing harry said the painter bitterly. lord henry shrugged his shoulders. it is the real dorian gray—that is all. it is not. if it is not what have i to do with it you should have gone away when i asked you he muttered. i stayed when you asked me was lord henrys answer. harry i cant quarrel with my two best friends at once but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work i have ever done and i will destroy it. what is it but canvas and colour i will not let it come across our three lives and mar them. dorian gray lifted his golden head from the pillow and with pallid face and tear-stained eyes looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. what was he doing there his fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes seeking for something. yes it was for the long palette-knife with its thin blade of lithe steel. he had found it at last. he was going to rip up the canvas. with a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch and rushing over to hallward tore the knife out of his hand and flung it to the end of the studio. dont basil dont he cried. it would be murder i am glad you appreciate my work at last dorian said the painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. i never thought you would. appreciate it i am in love with it basil. it is part of myself. i feel that. well as soon as you are dry you shall be varnished and framed and sent home. then you can do what you like with yourself. and he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea. you will have tea of course dorian and so will you harry or do you object to such simple pleasures i adore simple pleasures said lord henry. they are the last refuge of the complex. but i dont like scenes except on the stage. what absurd fellows you are both of you i wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. it was the most premature definition ever given. man is many things but he is not rational. i am glad he is not after all—though i wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. you had much better let me have it basil. this silly boy doesnt really want it and i really do. if you let any one have it but me basil i shall never forgive you cried dorian gray and i dont allow people to call me a silly boy. you know the picture is yours dorian. i gave it to you before it existed. and you know you have been a little silly gray and that you dont really object to being reminded that you are extremely young. i should have objected very strongly this morning lord henry. ah this morning you have lived since then. there came a knock at the door and the butler entered with a laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small japanese table. there was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted georgian urn. two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. dorian gray went over and poured out the tea. the two men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the covers. let us go to the theatre to-night said lord henry. there is sure to be something on somewhere. i have promised to dine at whites but it is only with an old friend so i can send him a wire to say that i am ill or that i am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement. i think that would be a rather nice excuse it would have all the surprise of candour. it is such a bore putting on ones dress-clothes muttered hallward. and when one has them on they are so horrid. yes answered lord henry dreamily the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable. it is so sombre so depressing. sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life. you really must not say things like that before dorian harry. before which dorian the one who is pouring out tea for us or the one in the picture before either. i should like to come to the theatre with you lord henry said the lad. then you shall come and you will come too basil wont you i cant really. i would sooner not. i have a lot of work to do. well then you and i will go alone gray. i should like that awfully. the painter bit his lip and walked over cup in hand to the picture. i shall stay with the real dorian he said sadly. is it the real dorian cried the original of the portrait strolling across to him. am i really like that yes you are just like that. how wonderful basil at least you are like it in appearance. but it will never alter sighed hallward. that is something. what a fuss people make about fidelity exclaimed lord henry. why even in love it is purely a question for physiology. it has nothing to do with our own will. young men want to be faithful and are not old men want to be faithless and cannot that is all one can say. dont go to the theatre to-night dorian said hallward. stop and dine with me. i cant basil. why because i have promised lord henry wotton to go with him. he wont like you the better for keeping your promises. he always breaks his own. i beg you not to go. dorian gray laughed and shook his head. i entreat you. the lad hesitated and looked over at lord henry who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile. i must go basil he answered. very well said hallward and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray. it is rather late and as you have to dress you had better lose no time. good-bye harry. good-bye dorian. come and see me soon. come to-morrow. certainly. you wont forget no of course not cried dorian. and ... harry yes basil remember what i asked you when we were in the garden this morning. i have forgotten it. i trust you. i wish i could trust myself said lord henry laughing. come gray my hansom is outside and i can drop you at your own place. good-bye basil. it has been a most interesting afternoon. as the door closed behind them the painter flung himself down on a sofa and a look of pain came into his face. chapter iii. at half-past twelve next day lord henry wotton strolled from curzon street over to the albany to call on his uncle lord fermor a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him but who was considered generous by society as he fed the people who amused him. his father had been our ambassador at madrid when isabella was young and prim unthought of but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the embassy at paris a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth his indolence the good english of his dispatches and his inordinate passion for pleasure. the son who had been his fathers secretary had resigned along with his chief somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time and on succeeding some months later to the title had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. he had two large town houses but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble and took most of his meals at his club. he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth. in politics he was a tory except when the tories were in office during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of radicals. he was a hero to his valet who bullied him and a terror to most of his relations whom he bullied in turn. only england could have produced him and he always said that the country was going to the dogs. his principles were out of date but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices. when lord henry entered the room he found his uncle sitting in a rough shooting-coat smoking a cheroot and grumbling over the times. well harry said the old gentleman what brings you out so early i thought you dandies never got up till two and were not visible till five. pure family affection i assure you uncle george. i want to get something out of you. money i suppose said lord fermor making a wry face. well sit down and tell me all about it. young people nowadays imagine that money is everything. yes murmured lord henry settling his button-hole in his coat and when they grow older they know it. but i dont want money. it is only people who pay their bills who want that uncle george and i never pay mine. credit is the capital of a younger son and one lives charmingly upon it. besides i always deal with dartmoors tradesmen and consequently they never bother me. what i want is information not useful information of course useless information. well i can tell you anything that is in an english blue book harry although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. when i was in the diplomatic things were much better. but i hear they let them in now by examination. what can you expect examinations sir are pure humbug from beginning to end. if a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him. dorian gray does not belong to blue books uncle george said lord henry languidly. dorian gray who is he asked lord fermor knitting his bushy white eyebrows. that is what i have come to learn uncle george. or rather i know who he is. he is the last lord kelsos grandson. his mother was a devereux lady margaret devereux. i want you to tell me about his mother. what was she like whom did she marry you have known nearly everybody in your time so you might have known her. i am very much interested in gray at present. i have only just met him. kelsos grandson echoed the old gentleman. kelsos grandson ... of course.... i knew his mother intimately. i believe i was at her christening. she was an extraordinarily beautiful girl margaret devereux and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow—a mere nobody sir a subaltern in a foot regiment or something of that kind. certainly. i remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday. the poor chap was killed in a duel at spa a few months after the marriage. there was an ugly story about it. they said kelso got some rascally adventurer some belgian brute to insult his son-in-law in public—paid him sir to do it paid him—and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. the thing was hushed up but egad kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards. he brought his daughter back with him i was told and she never spoke to him again. oh yes it was a bad business. the girl died too died within a year. so she left a son did she i had forgotten that. what sort of boy is he if he is like his mother he must be a good-looking chap. he is very good-looking assented lord henry. i hope he will fall into proper hands continued the old man. he should have a pot of money waiting for him if kelso did the right thing by him. his mother had money too. all the selby property came to her through her grandfather. her grandfather hated kelso thought him a mean dog. he was too. came to madrid once when i was there. egad i was ashamed of him. the queen used to ask me about the english noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. they made quite a story of it. i didnt dare show my face at court for a month. i hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies. i dont know answered lord henry. i fancy that the boy will be well off. he is not of age yet. he has selby i know. he told me so. and ... his mother was very beautiful margaret devereux was one of the loveliest creatures i ever saw harry. what on earth induced her to behave as she did i never could understand. she could have married anybody she chose. carlington was mad after her. she was romantic though. all the women of that family were. the men were a poor lot but egad the women were wonderful. carlington went on his knees to her. told me so himself. she laughed at him and there wasnt a girl in london at the time who wasnt after him. and by the way harry talking about silly marriages what is this humbug your father tells me about dartmoor wanting to marry an american aint english girls good enough for him it is rather fashionable to marry americans just now uncle george. ill back english women against the world harry said lord fermor striking the table with his fist. the betting is on the americans. they dont last i am told muttered his uncle. a long engagement exhausts them but they are capital at a steeplechase. they take things flying. i dont think dartmoor has a chance. who are her people grumbled the old gentleman. has she got any lord henry shook his head. american girls are as clever at concealing their parents as english women are at concealing their past he said rising to go. they are pork-packers i suppose i hope so uncle george for dartmoors sake. i am told that pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in america after politics. is she pretty she behaves as if she was beautiful. most american women do. it is the secret of their charm. why cant these american women stay in their own country they are always telling us that it is the paradise for women. it is. that is the reason why like eve they are so excessively anxious to get out of it said lord henry. good-bye uncle george. i shall be late for lunch if i stop any longer. thanks for giving me the information i wanted. i always like to know everything about my new friends and nothing about my old ones. where are you lunching harry at aunt agathas. i have asked myself and gray. he is her latest protégé. humph tell your aunt agatha harry not to bother me any more with her charity appeals. i am sick of them. why the good woman thinks that i have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads. all right uncle george ill tell her but it wont have any effect. philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. it is their distinguishing characteristic. the old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant. lord henry passed up the low arcade into burlington street and turned his steps in the direction of berkeley square. so that was the story of dorian grays parentage. crudely as it had been told to him it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange almost modern romance. a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous treacherous crime. months of voiceless agony and then a child born in pain. the mother snatched away by death the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. yes it was an interesting background. it posed the lad made him more perfect as it were. behind every exquisite thing that existed there was something tragic. worlds had to be in travail that the meanest flower might blow.... and how charming he had been at dinner the night before as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. he answered to every touch and thrill of the bow.... there was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. no other activity was like it. to project ones soul into some gracious form and let it tarry there for a moment to hear ones own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth to convey ones temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume there was a real joy in that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own an age grossly carnal in its pleasures and grossly common in its aims.... he was a marvellous type too this lad whom by so curious a chance he had met in basils studio or could be fashioned into a marvellous type at any rate. grace was his and the white purity of boyhood and beauty such as old greek marbles kept for us. there was nothing that one could not do with him. he could be made a titan or a toy. what a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade ... and basil from a psychological point of view how interesting he was the new manner in art the fresh mode of looking at life suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland and walked unseen in open field suddenly showing herself dryadlike and not afraid because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming as it were refined and gaining a kind of symbolical value as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real how strange it all was he remembered something like it in history. was it not plato that artist in thought who had first analyzed it was it not buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence but in our own century it was strange.... yes he would try to be to dorian gray what without knowing it the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. he would seek to dominate him—had already indeed half done so. he would make that wonderful spirit his own. there was something fascinating in this son of love and death. suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. he found that he had passed his aunts some distance and smiling to himself turned back. when he entered the somewhat sombre hall the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch. he gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room. late as usual harry cried his aunt shaking her head at him. he invented a facile excuse and having taken the vacant seat next to her looked round to see who was there. dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of the table a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek. opposite was the duchess of harley a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper much liked by every one who knew her and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness. next to her sat on her right sir thomas burdon a radical member of parliament who followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks dining with the tories and thinking with the liberals in accordance with a wise and well-known rule. the post on her left was occupied by erskine of treadley an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture who had fallen however into bad habits of silence having as he explained once to lady agatha said everything that he had to say before he was thirty. his own neighbour was vandeleur one of his aunts oldest friends a perfect saint amongst women but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book. fortunately for him she had on the other side lord faudel a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity as bald as a ministerial statement in the house of commons with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error as he remarked once himself that all really good people fall into and from which none of them ever quite escape. we are talking about poor dartmoor lord henry cried the duchess nodding pleasantly to him across the table. do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person i believe she has made up her mind to propose to him duchess. how dreadful exclaimed lady agatha. really some one should interfere. i am told on excellent authority that her father keeps an american dry-goods store said sir thomas burdon looking supercilious. my uncle has already suggested pork-packing sir thomas. dry-goods what are american dry-goods asked the duchess raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb. american novels answered lord henry helping himself to some quail. the duchess looked puzzled. dont mind him my dear whispered lady agatha. he never means anything that he says. when america was discovered said the radical member—and he began to give some wearisome facts. like all people who try to exhaust a subject he exhausted his listeners. the duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption. i wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all she exclaimed. really our girls have no chance nowadays. it is most unfair. perhaps after all america never has been discovered said erskine i myself would say that it had merely been detected. oh but i have seen specimens of the inhabitants answered the duchess vaguely. i must confess that most of them are extremely pretty. and they dress well too. they get all their dresses in paris. i wish i could afford to do the same. they say that when good americans die they go to paris chuckled sir thomas who had a large wardrobe of humours cast-off clothes. really and where do bad americans go to when they die inquired the duchess. they go to america murmured lord henry. sir thomas frowned. i am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country he said to lady agatha. i have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors who in such matters are extremely civil. i assure you that it is an education to visit it. but must we really see chicago in order to be educated asked erskine plaintively. i dont feel up to the journey. sir thomas waved his hand. erskine of treadley has the world on his shelves. we practical men like to see things not to read about them. the americans are an extremely interesting people. they are absolutely reasonable. i think that is their distinguishing characteristic. yes erskine an absolutely reasonable people. i assure you there is no nonsense about the americans. how dreadful cried lord henry. i can stand brute force but brute reason is quite unbearable. there is something unfair about its use. it is hitting below the intellect. i do not understand you said sir thomas growing rather red. i do lord henry murmured erskine with a smile. paradoxes are all very well in their way.... rejoined the baronet. was that a paradox asked erskine. i did not think so. perhaps it was. well the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. to test reality we must see it on the tight rope. when the verities become acrobats we can judge them. dear me said lady agatha how you men argue i am sure i never can make out what you are talking about. oh harry i am quite vexed with you. why do you try to persuade our nice dorian gray to give up the east end i assure you he would be quite invaluable. they would love his playing. i want him to play to me cried lord henry smiling and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance. but they are so unhappy in whitechapel continued lady agatha. i can sympathize with everything except suffering said lord henry shrugging his shoulders. i cannot sympathize with that. it is too ugly too horrible too distressing. there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. one should sympathize with the colour the beauty the joy of life. the less said about lifes sores the better. still the east end is a very important problem remarked sir thomas with a grave shake of the head. quite so answered the young lord. it is the problem of slavery and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves. the politician looked at him keenly. what change do you propose then he asked. lord henry laughed. i dont desire to change anything in england except the weather he answered. i am quite content with philosophic contemplation. but as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy i would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight. the advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional. but we have such grave responsibilities ventured vandeleur timidly. terribly grave echoed lady agatha. lord henry looked over at erskine. humanity takes itself too seriously. it is the worlds original sin. if the caveman had known how to laugh history would have been different. you are really very comforting warbled the duchess. i have always felt rather guilty when i came to see your dear aunt for i take no interest at all in the east end. for the future i shall be able to look her in the face without a blush. a blush is very becoming duchess remarked lord henry. only when one is young she answered. when an old woman like myself blushes it is a very bad sign. ah lord henry i wish you would tell me how to become young again. he thought for a moment. can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days duchess he asked looking at her across the table. a great many i fear she cried. then commit them over again he said gravely. to get back ones youth one has merely to repeat ones follies. a delightful theory she exclaimed. i must put it into practice. a dangerous theory came from sir thomass tight lips. lady agatha shook her head but could not help being amused. erskine listened. yes he continued that is one of the great secrets of life. nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are ones mistakes. a laugh ran round the table. he played with the idea and grew wilful tossed it into the air and transformed it let it escape and recaptured it made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox. the praise of folly as he went on soared into a philosophy and philosophy herself became young and catching the mad music of pleasure wearing one might fancy her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy danced like a bacchante over the hills of life and mocked the slow silenus for being sober. facts fled before her like frightened forest things. her white feet trod the huge press at which wise omar sits till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles or crawled in red foam over the vats black dripping sloping sides. it was an extraordinary improvisation. he felt that the eyes of dorian gray were fixed on him and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination. he was brilliant fantastic irresponsible. he charmed his listeners out of themselves and they followed his pipe laughing. dorian gray never took his gaze off him but sat like one under a spell smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes. at last liveried in the costume of the age reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting. she wrung her hands in mock despair. how annoying she cried. i must go. i have to call for my husband at the club to take him to some absurd meeting at williss rooms where he is going to be in the chair. if i am late he is sure to be furious and i couldnt have a scene in this bonnet. it is far too fragile. a harsh word would ruin it. no i must go dear agatha. good-bye lord henry you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. i am sure i dont know what to say about your views. you must come and dine with us some night. tuesday are you disengaged tuesday for you i would throw over anybody duchess said lord henry with a bow. ah that is very nice and very wrong of you she cried so mind you come and she swept out of the room followed by lady agatha and the other ladies. when lord henry had sat down again erskine moved round and taking a chair close to him placed his hand upon his arm. you talk books away he said why dont you write one i am too fond of reading books to care to write them erskine. i should like to write a novel certainly a novel that would be as lovely as a persian carpet and as unreal. but there is no literary public in england for anything except newspapers primers and encyclopaedias. of all people in the world the english have the least sense of the beauty of literature. i fear you are right answered erskine. i myself used to have literary ambitions but i gave them up long ago. and now my dear young friend if you will allow me to call you so may i ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch i quite forget what i said smiled lord henry. was it all very bad very bad indeed. in fact i consider you extremely dangerous and if anything happens to our good duchess we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible. but i should like to talk to you about life. the generation into which i was born was tedious. some day when you are tired of london come down to treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable burgundy i am fortunate enough to possess. i shall be charmed. a visit to treadley would be a great privilege. it has a perfect host and a perfect library. you will complete it answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow. and now i must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. i am due at the athenaeum. it is the hour when we sleep there. all of you erskine forty of us in forty arm-chairs. we are practising for an english academy of letters. lord henry laughed and rose. i am going to the park he cried. as he was passing out of the door dorian gray touched him on the arm. let me come with you he murmured. but i thought you had promised basil hallward to go and see him answered lord henry. i would sooner come with you yes i feel i must come with you. do let me. and you will promise to talk to me all the time no one talks so wonderfully as you do. ah i have talked quite enough for to-day said lord henry smiling. all i want now is to look at life. you may come and look at it with me if you care to. chapter iv. one afternoon a month later dorian gray was reclining in a luxurious arm-chair in the little library of lord henrys house in mayfair. it was in its way a very charming room with its high panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk long-fringed persian rugs. on a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by clodion and beside it lay a copy of les cent nouvelles bound for margaret of valois by clovis eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that queen had selected for her device. some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in london. lord henry had not yet come in. he was always late on principle his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. so the lad was looking rather sulky as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of manon lescaut that he had found in one of the book-cases. the formal monotonous ticking of the louis quatorze clock annoyed him. once or twice he thought of going away. at last he heard a step outside and the door opened. how late you are harry he murmured. i am afraid it is not harry gray answered a shrill voice. he glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. i beg your pardon. i thought— you thought it was my husband. it is only his wife. you must let me introduce myself. i know you quite well by your photographs. i think my husband has got seventeen of them. not seventeen lady henry well eighteen then. and i saw you with him the other night at the opera. she laughed nervously as she spoke and watched him with her vague forget-me-not eyes. she was a curious woman whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest. she was usually in love with somebody and as her passion was never returned she had kept all her illusions. she tried to look picturesque but only succeeded in being untidy. her name was victoria and she had a perfect mania for going to church. that was at lohengrin lady henry i think yes it was at dear lohengrin. i like wagners music better than anybodys. it is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says. that is a great advantage dont you think so gray the same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife. dorian smiled and shook his head i am afraid i dont think so lady henry. i never talk during music—at least during good music. if one hears bad music it is ones duty to drown it in conversation. ah that is one of harrys views isnt it gray i always hear harrys views from his friends. it is the only way i get to know of them. but you must not think i dont like good music. i adore it but i am afraid of it. it makes me too romantic. i have simply worshipped pianists—two at a time sometimes harry tells me. i dont know what it is about them. perhaps it is that they are foreigners. they all are aint they even those that are born in england become foreigners after a time dont they it is so clever of them and such a compliment to art. makes it quite cosmopolitan doesnt it you have never been to any of my parties have you gray you must come. i cant afford orchids but i spare no expense in foreigners. they make ones rooms look so picturesque. but here is harry harry i came in to look for you to ask you something—i forget what it was—and i found gray here. we have had such a pleasant chat about music. we have quite the same ideas. no i think our ideas are quite different. but he has been most pleasant. i am so glad ive seen him. i am charmed my love quite charmed said lord henry elevating his dark crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile. so sorry i am late dorian. i went to look after a piece of old brocade in wardour street and had to bargain for hours for it. nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. i am afraid i must be going exclaimed lady henry breaking an awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. i have promised to drive with the duchess. good-bye gray. good-bye harry. you are dining out i suppose so am i. perhaps i shall see you at lady thornburys. i dare say my dear said lord henry shutting the door behind her as looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain she flitted out of the room leaving a faint odour of frangipanni. then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa. never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair dorian he said after a few puffs. why harry because they are so sentimental. but i like sentimental people. never marry at all dorian. men marry because they are tired women because they are curious both are disappointed. i dont think i am likely to marry harry. i am too much in love. that is one of your aphorisms. i am putting it into practice as i do everything that you say. who are you in love with asked lord henry after a pause. with an actress said dorian gray blushing. lord henry shrugged his shoulders. that is a rather commonplace début. you would not say so if you saw her harry. who is she her name is sibyl vane. never heard of her. no one has. people will some day however. she is a genius. my dear boy no woman is a genius. women are a decorative sex. they never have anything to say but they say it charmingly. women represent the triumph of matter over mind just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals. harry how can you my dear dorian it is quite true. i am analysing women at present so i ought to know. the subject is not so abstruse as i thought it was. i find that ultimately there are only two kinds of women the plain and the coloured. the plain women are very useful. if you want to gain a reputation for respectability you have merely to take them down to supper. the other women are very charming. they commit one mistake however. they paint in order to try and look young. our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. rouge and esprit used to go together. that is all over now. as long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter she is perfectly satisfied. as for conversation there are only five women in london worth talking to and two of these cant be admitted into decent society. however tell me about your genius. how long have you known her ah harry your views terrify me. never mind that. how long have you known her about three weeks. and where did you come across her i will tell you harry but you mustnt be unsympathetic about it. after all it never would have happened if i had not met you. you filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. for days after i met you something seemed to throb in my veins. as i lounged in the park or strolled down piccadilly i used to look at every one who passed me and wonder with a mad curiosity what sort of lives they led. some of them fascinated me. others filled me with terror. there was an exquisite poison in the air. i had a passion for sensations.... well one evening about seven oclock i determined to go out in search of some adventure. i felt that this grey monstrous london of ours with its myriads of people its sordid sinners and its splendid sins as you once phrased it must have something in store for me. i fancied a thousand things. the mere danger gave me a sense of delight. i remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together about the search for beauty being the real secret of life. i dont know what i expected but i went out and wandered eastward soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares. about half-past eight i passed by an absurd little theatre with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. a hideous jew in the most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld in my life was standing at the entrance smoking a vile cigar. he had greasy ringlets and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ‘have a box my lord he said when he saw me and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility. there was something about him harry that amused me. he was such a monster. you will laugh at me i know but i really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. to the present day i cant make out why i did so and yet if i hadnt—my dear harry if i hadnt—i should have missed the greatest romance of my life. i see you are laughing. it is horrid of you i am not laughing dorian at least i am not laughing at you. but you should not say the greatest romance of your life. you should say the first romance of your life. you will always be loved and you will always be in love with love. a grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. that is the one use of the idle classes of a country. dont be afraid. there are exquisite things in store for you. this is merely the beginning. do you think my nature so shallow cried dorian gray angrily. no i think your nature so deep. how do you mean my dear boy the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. what they call their loyalty and their fidelity i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect—simply a confession of failure. faithfulness i must analyse it some day. the passion for property is in it. there are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up. but i dont want to interrupt you. go on with your story. well i found myself seated in a horrid little private box with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. i looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house. it was a tawdry affair all cupids and cornucopias like a third-rate wedding-cake. the gallery and pit were fairly full but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty and there was hardly a person in what i suppose they called the dress-circle. women went about with oranges and ginger-beer and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on. it must have been just like the palmy days of the british drama. just like i should fancy and very depressing. i began to wonder what on earth i should do when i caught sight of the play-bill. what do you think the play was harry i should think ‘the idiot boy or ‘dumb but innocent. our fathers used to like that sort of piece i believe. the longer i live dorian the more keenly i feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. in art as in politics les grandpères ont toujours tort. this play was good enough for us harry. it was romeo and juliet. i must admit that i was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place. still i felt interested in a sort of way. at any rate i determined to wait for the first act. there was a dreadful orchestra presided over by a young hebrew who sat at a cracked piano that nearly drove me away but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began. romeo was a stout elderly gentleman with corked eyebrows a husky tragedy voice and a figure like a beer-barrel. mercutio was almost as bad. he was played by the low-comedian who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit. they were both as grotesque as the scenery and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. but juliet harry imagine a girl hardly seventeen years of age with a little flowerlike face a small greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair eyes that were violet wells of passion lips that were like the petals of a rose. she was the loveliest thing i had ever seen in my life. you said to me once that pathos left you unmoved but that beauty mere beauty could fill your eyes with tears. i tell you harry i could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. and her voice—i never heard such a voice. it was very low at first with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon ones ear. then it became a little louder and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy. in the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. there were moments later on when it had the wild passion of violins. you know how a voice can stir one. your voice and the voice of sibyl vane are two things that i shall never forget. when i close my eyes i hear them and each of them says something different. i dont know which to follow. why should i not love her harry i do love her. she is everything to me in life. night after night i go to see her play. one evening she is rosalind and the next evening she is imogen. i have seen her die in the gloom of an italian tomb sucking the poison from her lovers lips. i have watched her wandering through the forest of arden disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. she has been mad and has come into the presence of a guilty king and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. she has been innocent and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat. i have seen her in every age and in every costume. ordinary women never appeal to ones imagination. they are limited to their century. no glamour ever transfigures them. one knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. one can always find them. there is no mystery in any of them. they ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. they have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. they are quite obvious. but an actress how different an actress is harry why didnt you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress because i have loved so many of them dorian. oh yes horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces. dont run down dyed hair and painted faces. there is an extraordinary charm in them sometimes said lord henry. i wish now i had not told you about sibyl vane. you could not have helped telling me dorian. all through your life you will tell me everything you do. yes harry i believe that is true. i cannot help telling you things. you have a curious influence over me. if i ever did a crime i would come and confess it to you. you would understand me. people like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—dont commit crimes dorian. but i am much obliged for the compliment all the same. and now tell me—reach me the matches like a good boy—thanks—what are your actual relations with sibyl vane dorian gray leaped to his feet with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. harry sibyl vane is sacred it is only the sacred things that are worth touching dorian said lord henry with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. but why should you be annoyed i suppose she will belong to you some day. when one is in love one always begins by deceiving ones self and one always ends by deceiving others. that is what the world calls a romance. you know her at any rate i suppose of course i know her. on the first night i was at the theatre the horrid old jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. i was furious with him and told him that juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in verona. i think from his blank look of amazement that he was under the impression that i had taken too much champagne or something. i am not surprised. then he asked me if i wrote for any of the newspapers. i told him i never even read them. he seemed terribly disappointed at that and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him and that they were every one of them to be bought. i should not wonder if he was quite right there. but on the other hand judging from their appearance most of them cannot be at all expensive. well he seemed to think they were beyond his means laughed dorian. by this time however the lights were being put out in the theatre and i had to go. he wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended. i declined. the next night of course i arrived at the place again. when he saw me he made me a low bow and assured me that i was a munificent patron of art. he was a most offensive brute though he had an extraordinary passion for shakespeare. he told me once with an air of pride that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘the bard as he insisted on calling him. he seemed to think it a distinction. it was a distinction my dear dorian—a great distinction. most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life. to have ruined ones self over poetry is an honour. but when did you first speak to miss sibyl vane the third night. she had been playing rosalind. i could not help going round. i had thrown her some flowers and she had looked at me—at least i fancied that she had. the old jew was persistent. he seemed determined to take me behind so i consented. it was curious my not wanting to know her wasnt it no i dont think so. my dear harry why i will tell you some other time. now i want to know about the girl. sibyl oh she was so shy and so gentle. there is something of a child about her. her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when i told her what i thought of her performance and she seemed quite unconscious of her power. i think we were both rather nervous. the old jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom making elaborate speeches about us both while we stood looking at each other like children. he would insist on calling me ‘my lord so i had to assure sibyl that i was not anything of the kind. she said quite simply to me ‘you look more like a prince. i must call you prince charming. upon my word dorian miss sibyl knows how to pay compliments. you dont understand her harry. she regarded me merely as a person in a play. she knows nothing of life. she lives with her mother a faded tired woman who played lady capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night and looks as if she had seen better days. i know that look. it depresses me murmured lord henry examining his rings. the jew wanted to tell me her history but i said it did not interest me. you were quite right. there is always something infinitely mean about other peoples tragedies. sibyl is the only thing i care about. what is it to me where she came from from her little head to her little feet she is absolutely and entirely divine. every night of my life i go to see her act and every night she is more marvellous. that is the reason i suppose that you never dine with me now. i thought you must have some curious romance on hand. you have but it is not quite what i expected. my dear harry we either lunch or sup together every day and i have been to the opera with you several times said dorian opening his blue eyes in wonder. you always come dreadfully late. well i cant help going to see sibyl play he cried even if it is only for a single act. i get hungry for her presence and when i think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body i am filled with awe. you can dine with me to-night dorian cant you he shook his head. to-night she is imogen he answered and to-morrow night she will be juliet. when is she sibyl vane never. i congratulate you. how horrid you are she is all the great heroines of the world in one. she is more than an individual. you laugh but i tell you she has genius. i love her and i must make her love me. you who know all the secrets of life tell me how to charm sibyl vane to love me i want to make romeo jealous. i want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad. i want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness to wake their ashes into pain. my god harry how i worship her he was walking up and down the room as he spoke. hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. he was terribly excited. lord henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. how different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in basil hallwards studio his nature had developed like a flower had borne blossoms of scarlet flame. out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul and desire had come to meet it on the way. and what do you propose to do said lord henry at last. i want you and basil to come with me some night and see her act. i have not the slightest fear of the result. you are certain to acknowledge her genius. then we must get her out of the jews hands. she is bound to him for three years—at least for two years and eight months—from the present time. i shall have to pay him something of course. when all that is settled i shall take a west end theatre and bring her out properly. she will make the world as mad as she has made me. that would be impossible my dear boy. yes she will. she has not merely art consummate art-instinct in her but she has personality also and you have often told me that it is personalities not principles that move the age. well what night shall we go let me see. to-day is tuesday. let us fix to-morrow. she plays juliet to-morrow. all right. the bristol at eight oclock and i will get basil. not eight harry please. half-past six. we must be there before the curtain rises. you must see her in the first act where she meets romeo. half-past six what an hour it will be like having a meat-tea or reading an english novel. it must be seven. no gentleman dines before seven. shall you see basil between this and then or shall i write to him dear basil i have not laid eyes on him for a week. it is rather horrid of me as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame specially designed by himself and though i am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than i am i must admit that i delight in it. perhaps you had better write to him. i dont want to see him alone. he says things that annoy me. he gives me good advice. lord henry smiled. people are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves. it is what i call the depth of generosity. oh basil is the best of fellows but he seems to me to be just a bit of a philistine. since i have known you harry i have discovered that. basil my dear boy puts everything that is charming in him into his work. the consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices his principles and his common sense. the only artists i have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. good artists exist simply in what they make and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. a great poet a really great poet is the most unpoetical of all creatures. but inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. the worse their rhymes are the more picturesque they look. the mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. he lives the poetry that he cannot write. the others write the poetry that they dare not realize. i wonder is that really so harry said dorian gray putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large gold-topped bottle that stood on the table. it must be if you say it. and now i am off. imogen is waiting for me. dont forget about to-morrow. good-bye. as he left the room lord henrys heavy eyelids drooped and he began to think. certainly few people had ever interested him so much as dorian gray and yet the lads mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. he was pleased by it. it made him a more interesting study. he had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. and so he had begun by vivisecting himself as he had ended by vivisecting others. human life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. compared to it there was nothing else of any value. it was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure one could not wear over ones face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. there were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. there were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. and yet what a great reward one received how wonderful the whole world became to one to note the curious hard logic of passion and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to observe where they met and where they separated at what point they were in unison and at what point they were at discord—there was a delight in that what matter what the cost was one could never pay too high a price for any sensation. he was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his musical words said with musical utterance that dorian grays soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. to a large extent the lad was his own creation. he had made him premature. that was something. ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets but to the few to the elect the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. sometimes this was the effect of art and chiefly of the art of literature which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. but now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art was indeed in its way a real work of art life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has or sculpture or painting. yes the lad was premature. he was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring. the pulse and passion of youth were in him but he was becoming self-conscious. it was delightful to watch him. with his beautiful face and his beautiful soul he was a thing to wonder at. it was no matter how it all ended or was destined to end. he was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play whose joys seem to be remote from one but whose sorrows stir ones sense of beauty and whose wounds are like red roses. soul and body body and soul—how mysterious they were there was animalism in the soul and the body had its moments of spirituality. the senses could refine and the intellect could degrade. who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased or the psychical impulse began how shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists and yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin or was the body really in the soul as giordano bruno thought the separation of spirit from matter was a mystery and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also. he began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. as it was we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others. experience was of no ethical value. it was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. moralists had as a rule regarded it as a mode of warning had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. but there was no motive power in experience. it was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. all that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past and that the sin we had done once and with loathing we would do many times and with joy. it was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions and certainly dorian gray was a subject made to his hand and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. his sudden mad love for sibyl vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. there was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it curiosity and the desire for new experiences yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion. what there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. it was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us. our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious. it often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves. while lord henry sat dreaming on these things a knock came to the door and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner. he got up and looked out into the street. the sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. the panes glowed like plates of heated metal. the sky above was like a faded rose. he thought of his friends young fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end. when he arrived home about half-past twelve oclock he saw a telegram lying on the hall table. he opened it and found it was from dorian gray. it was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to sibyl vane. chapter v. mother mother i am so happy whispered the girl burying her face in the lap of the faded tired-looking woman who with back turned to the shrill intrusive light was sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained. i am so happy she repeated and you must be happy too vane winced and put her thin bismuth-whitened hands on her daughters head. happy she echoed i am only happy sibyl when i see you act. you must not think of anything but your acting. isaacs has been very good to us and we owe him money. the girl looked up and pouted. money mother she cried what does money matter love is more than money. isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for james. you must not forget that sibyl. fifty pounds is a very large sum. isaacs has been most considerate. he is not a gentleman mother and i hate the way he talks to me said the girl rising to her feet and going over to the window. i dont know how we could manage without him answered the elder woman querulously. sibyl vane tossed her head and laughed. we dont want him any more mother. prince charming rules life for us now. then she paused. a rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. quick breath parted the petals of her lips. they trembled. some southern wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. i love him she said simply. foolish child foolish child was the parrot-phrase flung in answer. the waving of crooked false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the words. the girl laughed again. the joy of a caged bird was in her voice. her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance then closed for a moment as though to hide their secret. when they opened the mist of a dream had passed across them. thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair hinted at prudence quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense. she did not listen. she was free in her prison of passion. her prince prince charming was with her. she had called on memory to remake him. she had sent her soul to search for him and it had brought him back. his kiss burned again upon her mouth. her eyelids were warm with his breath. then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. this young man might be rich. if so marriage should be thought of. against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. the arrows of craft shot by her. she saw the thin lips moving and smiled. suddenly she felt the need to speak. the wordy silence troubled her. mother mother she cried why does he love me so much i know why i love him. i love him because he is like what love himself should be. but what does he see in me i am not worthy of him. and yet—why i cannot tell—though i feel so much beneath him i dont feel humble. i feel proud terribly proud. mother did you love my father as i love prince charming the elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. sybil rushed to her flung her arms round her neck and kissed her. forgive me mother. i know it pains you to talk about our father. but it only pains you because you loved him so much. dont look so sad. i am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. ah let me be happy for ever my child you are far too young to think of falling in love. besides what do you know of this young man you dont even know his name. the whole thing is most inconvenient and really when james is going away to australia and i have so much to think of i must say that you should have shown more consideration. however as i said before if he is rich ... ah mother mother let me be happy vane glanced at her and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage-player clasped her in her arms. at this moment the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. he was thick-set of figure and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement. he was not so finely bred as his sister. one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them. vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. she felt sure that the tableau was interesting. you might keep some of your kisses for me sibyl i think said the lad with a good-natured grumble. ah but you dont like being kissed jim she cried. you are a dreadful old bear. and she ran across the room and hugged him. james vane looked into his sisters face with tenderness. i want you to come out with me for a walk sibyl. i dont suppose i shall ever see this horrid london again. i am sure i dont want to. my son dont say such dreadful things murmured vane taking up a tawdry theatrical dress with a sigh and beginning to patch it. she felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. it would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation. why not mother i mean it. you pain me my son. i trust you will return from australia in a position of affluence. i believe there is no society of any kind in the colonies—nothing that i would call society—so when you have made your fortune you must come back and assert yourself in london. society muttered the lad. i dont want to know anything about that. i should like to make some money to take you and sibyl off the stage. i hate it. oh jim said sibyl laughing how unkind of you but are you really going for a walk with me that will be nice i was afraid you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends—to tom hardy who gave you that hideous pipe or ned langton who makes fun of you for smoking it. it is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. where shall we go let us go to the park. i am too shabby he answered frowning. only swell people go to the park. nonsense jim she whispered stroking the sleeve of his coat. he hesitated for a moment. very well he said at last but dont be too long dressing. she danced out of the door. one could hear her singing as she ran upstairs. her little feet pattered overhead. he walked up and down the room two or three times. then he turned to the still figure in the chair. mother are my things ready he asked. quite ready james she answered keeping her eyes on her work. for some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers. her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met. she used to wonder if he suspected anything. the silence for he made no other observation became intolerable to her. she began to complain. women defend themselves by attacking just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. i hope you will be contented james with your sea-faring life she said. you must remember that it is your own choice. you might have entered a solicitors office. solicitors are a very respectable class and in the country often dine with the best families. i hate offices and i hate clerks he replied. but you are quite right. i have chosen my own life. all i say is watch over sibyl. dont let her come to any harm. mother you must watch over her. james you really talk very strangely. of course i watch over sibyl. i hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her. is that right what about that you are speaking about things you dont understand james. in the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention. i myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. that was when acting was really understood. as for sibyl i do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not. but there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. he is always most polite to me. besides he has the appearance of being rich and the flowers he sends are lovely. you dont know his name though said the lad harshly. no answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. he has not yet revealed his real name. i think it is quite romantic of him. he is probably a member of the aristocracy. james vane bit his lip. watch over sibyl mother he cried watch over her. my son you distress me very much. sibyl is always under my special care. of course if this gentleman is wealthy there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him. i trust he is one of the aristocracy. he has all the appearance of it i must say. it might be a most brilliant marriage for sibyl. they would make a charming couple. his good looks are really quite remarkable everybody notices them. the lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his coarse fingers. he had just turned round to say something when the door opened and sibyl ran in. how serious you both are she cried. what is the matter nothing he answered. i suppose one must be serious sometimes. good-bye mother i will have my dinner at five oclock. everything is packed except my shirts so you need not trouble. good-bye my son she answered with a bow of strained stateliness. she was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her and there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid. kiss me mother said the girl. her flowerlike lips touched the withered cheek and warmed its frost. my child my child cried vane looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery. come sibyl said her brother impatiently. he hated his mothers affectations. they went out into the flickering wind-blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary euston road. the passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who in coarse ill-fitting clothes was in the company of such a graceful refined-looking girl. he was like a common gardener walking with a rose. jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger. he had that dislike of being stared at which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. sibyl however was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. her love was trembling in laughter on her lips. she was thinking of prince charming and that she might think of him all the more she did not talk of him but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail about the gold he was certain to find about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked red-shirted bushrangers. for he was not to remain a sailor or a supercargo or whatever he was going to be. oh no a sailors existence was dreadful. fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship with the hoarse hump-backed waves trying to get in and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands he was to leave the vessel at melbourne bid a polite good-bye to the captain and go off at once to the gold-fields. before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold the largest nugget that had ever been discovered and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. the bushrangers were to attack them three times and be defeated with immense slaughter. or no. he was not to go to the gold-fields at all. they were horrid places where men got intoxicated and shot each other in bar-rooms and used bad language. he was to be a nice sheep-farmer and one evening as he was riding home he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse and give chase and rescue her. of course she would fall in love with him and he with her and they would get married and come home and live in an immense house in london. yes there were delightful things in store for him. but he must be very good and not lose his temper or spend his money foolishly. she was only a year older than he was but she knew so much more of life. he must be sure also to write to her by every mail and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. god was very good and would watch over him. she would pray for him too and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy. the lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. he was heart-sick at leaving home. yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose. inexperienced though he was he had still a strong sense of the danger of sibyls position. this young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good. he was a gentleman and he hated him for that hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. he was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mothers nature and in that saw infinite peril for sibyl and sibyls happiness. children begin by loving their parents as they grow older they judge them sometimes they forgive them. his mother he had something on his mind to ask of her something that he had brooded on for many months of silence. a chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door had set loose a train of horrible thoughts. he remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face. his brows knit together into a wedge-like furrow and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip. you are not listening to a word i am saying jim cried sibyl and i am making the most delightful plans for your future. do say something. what do you want me to say oh that you will be a good boy and not forget us she answered smiling at him. he shrugged his shoulders. you are more likely to forget me than i am to forget you sibyl. she flushed. what do you mean jim she asked. you have a new friend i hear. who is he why have you not told me about him he means you no good. stop jim she exclaimed. you must not say anything against him. i love him. why you dont even know his name answered the lad. who is he i have a right to know. he is called prince charming. dont you like the name. oh you silly boy you should never forget it. if you only saw him you would think him the most wonderful person in the world. some day you will meet him—when you come back from australia. you will like him so much. everybody likes him and i ... love him. i wish you could come to the theatre to-night. he is going to be there and i am to play juliet. oh how i shall play it fancy jim to be in love and play juliet to have him sitting there to play for his delight i am afraid i may frighten the company frighten or enthrall them. to be in love is to surpass ones self. poor dreadful isaacs will be shouting ‘genius to his loafers at the bar. he has preached me as a dogma to-night he will announce me as a revelation. i feel it. and it is all his his only prince charming my wonderful lover my god of graces. but i am poor beside him. poor what does that matter when poverty creeps in at the door love flies in through the window. our proverbs want rewriting. they were made in winter and it is summer now spring-time for me i think a very dance of blossoms in blue skies. he is a gentleman said the lad sullenly. a prince she cried musically. what more do you want he wants to enslave you. i shudder at the thought of being free. i want you to beware of him. to see him is to worship him to know him is to trust him. sibyl you are mad about him. she laughed and took his arm. you dear old jim you talk as if you were a hundred. some day you will be in love yourself. then you will know what it is. dont look so sulky. surely you should be glad to think that though you are going away you leave me happier than i have ever been before. life has been hard for us both terribly hard and difficult. but it will be different now. you are going to a new world and i have found one. here are two chairs let us sit down and see the smart people go by. they took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. the tulip-beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. a white dust—tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air. the brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies. she made her brother talk of himself his hopes his prospects. he spoke slowly and with effort. they passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters. sibyl felt oppressed. she could not communicate her joy. a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win. after some time she became silent. suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips and in an open carriage with two ladies dorian gray drove past. she started to her feet. there he is she cried. who said jim vane. prince charming she answered looking after the victoria. he jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. show him to me. which is he point him out. i must see him he exclaimed but at that moment the duke of berwicks four-in-hand came between and when it had left the space clear the carriage had swept out of the park. he is gone murmured sibyl sadly. i wish you had seen him. i wish i had for as sure as there is a god in heaven if he ever does you any wrong i shall kill him. she looked at him in horror. he repeated his words. they cut the air like a dagger. the people round began to gape. a lady standing close to her tittered. come away jim come away she whispered. he followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd. he felt glad at what he had said. when they reached the achilles statue she turned round. there was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. she shook her head at him. you are foolish jim utterly foolish a bad-tempered boy that is all. how can you say such horrible things you dont know what you are talking about. you are simply jealous and unkind. ah i wish you would fall in love. love makes people good and what you said was wicked. i am sixteen he answered and i know what i am about. mother is no help to you. she doesnt understand how to look after you. i wish now that i was not going to australia at all. i have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up. i would if my articles hadnt been signed. oh dont be so serious jim. you are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas mother used to be so fond of acting in. i am not going to quarrel with you. i have seen him and oh to see him is perfect happiness. we wont quarrel. i know you would never harm any one i love would you not as long as you love him i suppose was the sullen answer. i shall love him for ever she cried. and he for ever too he had better. she shrank from him. then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. he was merely a boy. at the marble arch they hailed an omnibus which left them close to their shabby home in the euston road. it was after five oclock and sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. jim insisted that she should do so. he said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not present. she would be sure to make a scene and he detested scenes of every kind. in sybils own room they parted. there was jealousy in the lads heart and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who as it seemed to him had come between them. yet when her arms were flung round his neck and her fingers strayed through his hair he softened and kissed her with real affection. there were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs. his mother was waiting for him below. she grumbled at his unpunctuality as he entered. he made no answer but sat down to his meagre meal. the flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth. through the rumble of omnibuses and the clatter of street-cabs he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him. after some time he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hands. he felt that he had a right to know. it should have been told to him before if it was as he suspected. leaden with fear his mother watched him. words dropped mechanically from her lips. a tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers. when the clock struck six he got up and went to the door. then he turned back and looked at her. their eyes met. in hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. it enraged him. mother i have something to ask you he said. her eyes wandered vaguely about the room. she made no answer. tell me the truth. i have a right to know. were you married to my father she heaved a deep sigh. it was a sigh of relief. the terrible moment the moment that night and day for weeks and months she had dreaded had come at last and yet she felt no terror. indeed in some measure it was a disappointment to her. the vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer. the situation had not been gradually led up to. it was crude. it reminded her of a bad rehearsal. no she answered wondering at the harsh simplicity of life. my father was a scoundrel then cried the lad clenching his fists. she shook her head. i knew he was not free. we loved each other very much. if he had lived he would have made provision for us. dont speak against him my son. he was your father and a gentleman. indeed he was highly connected. an oath broke from his lips. i dont care for myself he exclaimed but dont let sibyl.... it is a gentleman isnt it who is in love with her or says he is highly connected too i suppose. for a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. her head drooped. she wiped her eyes with shaking hands. sibyl has a mother she murmured i had none. the lad was touched. he went towards her and stooping down he kissed her. i am sorry if i have pained you by asking about my father he said but i could not help it. i must go now. good-bye. dont forget that you will have only one child now to look after and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister i will find out who he is track him down and kill him like a dog. i swear it. the exaggerated folly of the threat the passionate gesture that accompanied it the mad melodramatic words made life seem more vivid to her. she was familiar with the atmosphere. she breathed more freely and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. she would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale but he cut her short. trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for. the lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. there was the bargaining with the cabman. the moment was lost in vulgar details. it was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window as her son drove away. she was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. she consoled herself by telling sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be now that she had only one child to look after. she remembered the phrase. it had pleased her. of the threat she said nothing. it was vividly and dramatically expressed. she felt that they would all laugh at it some day. chapter vi. i suppose you have heard the news basil said lord henry that evening as hallward was shown into a little private room at the bristol where dinner had been laid for three. no harry answered the artist giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter. what is it nothing about politics i hope they dont interest me. there is hardly a single person in the house of commons worth painting though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing. dorian gray is engaged to be married said lord henry watching him as he spoke. hallward started and then frowned. dorian engaged to be married he cried. impossible it is perfectly true. to whom to some little actress or other. i cant believe it. dorian is far too sensible. dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then my dear basil. marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then harry. except in america rejoined lord henry languidly. but i didnt say he was married. i said he was engaged to be married. there is a great difference. i have a distinct remembrance of being married but i have no recollection at all of being engaged. i am inclined to think that i never was engaged. but think of dorians birth and position and wealth. it would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him. if you want to make him marry this girl tell him that basil. he is sure to do it then. whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing it is always from the noblest motives. i hope the girl is good harry. i dont want to see dorian tied to some vile creature who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect. oh she is better than good—she is beautiful murmured lord henry sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. dorian says she is beautiful and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people. it has had that excellent effect amongst others. we are to see her to-night if that boy doesnt forget his appointment. are you serious quite serious basil. i should be miserable if i thought i should ever be more serious than i am at the present moment. but do you approve of it harry asked the painter walking up and down the room and biting his lip. you cant approve of it possibly. it is some silly infatuation. i never approve or disapprove of anything now. it is an absurd attitude to take towards life. we are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. i never take any notice of what common people say and i never interfere with what charming people do. if a personality fascinates me whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. dorian gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts juliet and proposes to marry her. why not if he wedded messalina he would be none the less interesting. you know i am not a champion of marriage. the real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. and unselfish people are colourless. they lack individuality. still there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. they retain their egotism and add to it many other egos. they are forced to have more than one life. they become more highly organized and to be highly organized is i should fancy the object of mans existence. besides every experience is of value and whatever one may say against marriage it is certainly an experience. i hope that dorian gray will make this girl his wife passionately adore her for six months and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else. he would be a wonderful study. you dont mean a single word of all that harry you know you dont. if dorian grays life were spoiled no one would be sorrier than yourself. you are much better than you pretend to be. lord henry laughed. the reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. the basis of optimism is sheer terror. we think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us. we praise the banker that we may overdraw our account and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets. i mean everything that i have said. i have the greatest contempt for optimism. as for a spoiled life no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. if you want to mar a nature you have merely to reform it. as for marriage of course that would be silly but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. i will certainly encourage them. they have the charm of being fashionable. but here is dorian himself. he will tell you more than i can. my dear harry my dear basil you must both congratulate me said the lad throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. i have never been so happy. of course it is sudden—all really delightful things are. and yet it seems to me to be the one thing i have been looking for all my life. he was flushed with excitement and pleasure and looked extraordinarily handsome. i hope you will always be very happy dorian said hallward but i dont quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement. you let harry know. and i dont forgive you for being late for dinner broke in lord henry putting his hand on the lads shoulder and smiling as he spoke. come let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like and then you will tell us how it all came about. there is really not much to tell cried dorian as they took their seats at the small round table. what happened was simply this. after i left you yesterday evening harry i dressed had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to and went down at eight oclock to the theatre. sibyl was playing rosalind. of course the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd. but sibyl you should have seen her when she came on in her boys clothes she was perfectly wonderful. she wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves slim brown cross-gartered hose a dainty little green cap with a hawks feather caught in a jewel and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. she had never seemed to me more exquisite. she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio basil. her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. as for her acting—well you shall see her to-night. she is simply a born artist. i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century. i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. after the performance was over i went behind and spoke to her. as we were sitting together suddenly there came into her eyes a look that i had never seen there before. my lips moved towards hers. we kissed each other. i cant describe to you what i felt at that moment. it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus. then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. i feel that i should not tell you all this but i cant help it. of course our engagement is a dead secret. she has not even told her own mother. i dont know what my guardians will say. lord radley is sure to be furious. i dont care. i shall be of age in less than a year and then i can do what i like. i have been right basil havent i to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeares plays lips that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. i have had the arms of rosalind around me and kissed juliet on the mouth. yes dorian i suppose you were right said hallward slowly. have you seen her to-day asked lord henry. dorian gray shook his head. i left her in the forest of arden i shall find her in an orchard in verona. lord henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. at what particular point did you mention the word marriage dorian and what did she say in answer perhaps you forgot all about it. my dear harry i did not treat it as a business transaction and i did not make any formal proposal. i told her that i loved her and she said she was not worthy to be my wife. not worthy why the whole world is nothing to me compared with her. women are wonderfully practical murmured lord henry much more practical than we are. in situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage and they always remind us. hallward laid his hand upon his arm. dont harry. you have annoyed dorian. he is not like other men. he would never bring misery upon any one. his nature is too fine for that. lord henry looked across the table. dorian is never annoyed with me he answered. i asked the question for the best reason possible for the only reason indeed that excuses one for asking any question—simple curiosity. i have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us and not we who propose to the women. except of course in middle-class life. but then the middle classes are not modern. dorian gray laughed and tossed his head. you are quite incorrigible harry but i dont mind. it is impossible to be angry with you. when you see sibyl vane you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast a beast without a heart. i cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves. i love sibyl vane. i want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine. what is marriage an irrevocable vow. you mock at it for that. ah dont mock. it is an irrevocable vow that i want to take. her trust makes me faithful her belief makes me good. when i am with her i regret all that you have taught me. i become different from what you have known me to be. i am changed and the mere touch of sibyl vanes hand makes me forget you and all your wrong fascinating poisonous delightful theories. and those are ... asked lord henry helping himself to some salad. oh your theories about life your theories about love your theories about pleasure. all your theories in fact harry. pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about he answered in his slow melodious voice. but i am afraid i cannot claim my theory as my own. it belongs to nature not to me. pleasure is natures test her sign of approval. when we are happy we are always good but when we are good we are not always happy. ah but what do you mean by good cried basil hallward. yes echoed dorian leaning back in his chair and looking at lord henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table what do you mean by good harry to be good is to be in harmony with ones self he replied touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale fine-pointed fingers. discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. ones own life—that is the important thing. as for the lives of ones neighbours if one wishes to be a prig or a puritan one can flaunt ones moral views about them but they are not ones concern. besides individualism has really the higher aim. modern morality consists in accepting the standard of ones age. i consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality. but surely if one lives merely for ones self harry one pays a terrible price for doing so suggested the painter. yes we are overcharged for everything nowadays. i should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self-denial. beautiful sins like beautiful things are the privilege of the rich. one has to pay in other ways but money. what sort of ways basil oh i should fancy in remorse in suffering in ... well in the consciousness of degradation. lord henry shrugged his shoulders. my dear fellow mediæval art is charming but mediæval emotions are out of date. one can use them in fiction of course. but then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. believe me no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is. i know what pleasure is cried dorian gray. it is to adore some one. that is certainly better than being adored he answered toying with some fruits. being adored is a nuisance. women treat us just as humanity treats its gods. they worship us and are always bothering us to do something for them. i should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us murmured the lad gravely. they create love in our natures. they have a right to demand it back. that is quite true dorian cried hallward. nothing is ever quite true said lord henry. this is interrupted dorian. you must admit harry that women give to men the very gold of their lives. possibly he sighed but they invariably want it back in such very small change. that is the worry. women as some witty frenchman once put it inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out. harry you are dreadful i dont know why i like you so much. you will always like me dorian he replied. will you have some coffee you fellows waiter bring coffee and fine-champagne and some cigarettes. no dont mind the cigarettes—i have some. basil i cant allow you to smoke cigars. you must have a cigarette. a cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. it is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied. what more can one want yes dorian you will always be fond of me. i represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit. what nonsense you talk harry cried the lad taking a light from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table. let us go down to the theatre. when sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life. she will represent something to you that you have never known. i have known everything said lord henry with a tired look in his eyes but i am always ready for a new emotion. i am afraid however that for me at any rate there is no such thing. still your wonderful girl may thrill me. i love acting. it is so much more real than life. let us go. dorian you will come with me. i am so sorry basil but there is only room for two in the brougham. you must follow us in a hansom. they got up and put on their coats sipping their coffee standing. the painter was silent and preoccupied. there was a gloom over him. he could not bear this marriage and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened. after a few minutes they all passed downstairs. he drove off by himself as had been arranged and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him. a strange sense of loss came over him. he felt that dorian gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past. life had come between them.... his eyes darkened and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. when the cab drew up at the theatre it seemed to him that he had grown years older. chapter vii. for some reason or other the house was crowded that night and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile. he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice. dorian gray loathed him more than ever. he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban. lord henry upon the other hand rather liked him. at least he declared he did and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet. hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. the heat was terribly oppressive and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. the youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. they talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. some women were laughing in the pit. their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. the sound of the popping of corks came from the bar. what a place to find ones divinity in said lord henry. yes answered dorian gray. it was here i found her and she is divine beyond all living things. when she acts you will forget everything. these common rough people with their coarse faces and brutal gestures become quite different when she is on the stage. they sit silently and watch her. they weep and laugh as she wills them to do. she makes them as responsive as a violin. she spiritualizes them and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as ones self. the same flesh and blood as ones self oh i hope not exclaimed lord henry who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass. dont pay any attention to him dorian said the painter. i understand what you mean and i believe in this girl. any one you love must be marvellous and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble. to spiritualize ones age—that is something worth doing. if this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own she is worthy of all your adoration worthy of the adoration of the world. this marriage is quite right. i did not think so at first but i admit it now. the gods made sibyl vane for you. without her you would have been incomplete. thanks basil answered dorian gray pressing his hand. i knew that you would understand me. harry is so cynical he terrifies me. but here is the orchestra. it is quite dreadful but it only lasts for about five minutes. then the curtain rises and you will see the girl to whom i am going to give all my life to whom i have given everything that is good in me. a quarter of an hour afterwards amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause sibyl vane stepped on to the stage. yes she was certainly lovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures lord henry thought that he had ever seen. there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. a faint blush like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house. she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble. basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud. motionless and as one in a dream sat dorian gray gazing at her. lord henry peered through his glasses murmuring charming charming the scene was the hall of capulets house and romeo in his pilgrims dress had entered with mercutio and his other friends. the band such as it was struck up a few bars of music and the dance began. through the crowd of ungainly shabbily dressed actors sibyl vane moved like a creature from a finer world. her body swayed while she danced as a plant sways in the water. the curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily. her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory. yet she was curiously listless. she showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on romeo. the few words she had to speak— good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss— with the brief dialogue that follows were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner. the voice was exquisite but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false. it was wrong in colour. it took away all the life from the verse. it made the passion unreal. dorian gray grew pale as he watched her. he was puzzled and anxious. neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. she seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent. they were horribly disappointed. yet they felt that the true test of any juliet is the balcony scene of the second act. they waited for that. if she failed there there was nothing in her. she looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. that could not be denied. but the staginess of her acting was unbearable and grew worse as she went on. her gestures became absurdly artificial. she overemphasized everything that she had to say. the beautiful passage— thou knowest the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night— was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. when she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines— although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract to-night it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens. sweet good-night this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet— she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. it was not nervousness. indeed so far from being nervous she was absolutely self-contained. it was simply bad art. she was a complete failure. even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play. they got restless and began to talk loudly and to whistle. the jew manager who was standing at the back of the dress-circle stamped and swore with rage. the only person unmoved was the girl herself. when the second act was over there came a storm of hisses and lord henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. she is quite beautiful dorian he said but she cant act. let us go. i am going to see the play through answered the lad in a hard bitter voice. i am awfully sorry that i have made you waste an evening harry. i apologize to you both. my dear dorian i should think miss vane was ill interrupted hallward. we will come some other night. i wish she were ill he rejoined. but she seems to me to be simply callous and cold. she has entirely altered. last night she was a great artist. this evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress. dont talk like that about any one you love dorian. love is a more wonderful thing than art. they are both simply forms of imitation remarked lord henry. but do let us go. dorian you must not stay here any longer. it is not good for ones morals to see bad acting. besides i dont suppose you will want your wife to act so what does it matter if she plays juliet like a wooden doll she is very lovely and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting she will be a delightful experience. there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing. good heavens my dear boy dont look so tragic the secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. come to the club with basil and myself. we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl vane. she is beautiful. what more can you want go away harry cried the lad. i want to be alone. basil you must go. ah cant you see that my heart is breaking the hot tears came to his eyes. his lips trembled and rushing to the back of the box he leaned up against the wall hiding his face in his hands. let us go basil said lord henry with a strange tenderness in his voice and the two young men passed out together. a few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act. dorian gray went back to his seat. he looked pale and proud and indifferent. the play dragged on and seemed interminable. half of the audience went out tramping in heavy boots and laughing. the whole thing was a fiasco. the last act was played to almost empty benches. the curtain went down on a titter and some groans. as soon as it was over dorian gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom. the girl was standing there alone with a look of triumph on her face. her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. there was a radiance about her. her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own. when he entered she looked at him and an expression of infinite joy came over her. how badly i acted to-night dorian she cried. horribly he answered gazing at her in amazement. horribly it was dreadful. are you ill you have no idea what it was. you have no idea what i suffered. the girl smiled. dorian she answered lingering over his name with long-drawn music in her voice as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth. dorian you should have understood. but you understand now dont you understand what he asked angrily. why i was so bad to-night. why i shall always be bad. why i shall never act well again. he shrugged his shoulders. you are ill i suppose. when you are ill you shouldnt act. you make yourself ridiculous. my friends were bored. i was bored. she seemed not to listen to him. she was transfigured with joy. an ecstasy of happiness dominated her. dorian dorian she cried before i knew you acting was the one reality of my life. it was only in the theatre that i lived. i thought that it was all true. i was rosalind one night and portia the other. the joy of beatrice was my joy and the sorrows of cordelia were mine also. i believed in everything. the common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. the painted scenes were my world. i knew nothing but shadows and i thought them real. you came—oh my beautiful love—and you freed my soul from prison. you taught me what reality really is. to-night for the first time in my life i saw through the hollowness the sham the silliness of the empty pageant in which i had always played. to-night for the first time i became conscious that the romeo was hideous and old and painted that the moonlight in the orchard was false that the scenery was vulgar and that the words i had to speak were unreal were not my words were not what i wanted to say. you had brought me something higher something of which all art is but a reflection. you had made me understand what love really is. my love my love prince charming prince of life i have grown sick of shadows. you are more to me than all art can ever be. what have i to do with the puppets of a play when i came on to-night i could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me. i thought that i was going to be wonderful. i found that i could do nothing. suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. the knowledge was exquisite to me. i heard them hissing and i smiled. what could they know of love such as ours take me away dorian—take me away with you where we can be quite alone. i hate the stage. i might mimic a passion that i do not feel but i cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. oh dorian dorian you understand now what it signifies even if i could do it it would be profanation for me to play at being in love. you have made me see that. he flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. you have killed my love he muttered. she looked at him in wonder and laughed. he made no answer. she came across to him and with her little fingers stroked his hair. she knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips. he drew them away and a shudder ran through him. then he leaped up and went to the door. yes he cried you have killed my love. you used to stir my imagination. now you dont even stir my curiosity. you simply produce no effect. i loved you because you were marvellous because you had genius and intellect because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art. you have thrown it all away. you are shallow and stupid. my god how mad i was to love you what a fool i have been you are nothing to me now. i will never see you again. i will never think of you. i will never mention your name. you dont know what you were to me once. why once ... oh i cant bear to think of it i wish i had never laid eyes upon you you have spoiled the romance of my life. how little you can know of love if you say it mars your art without your art you are nothing. i would have made you famous splendid magnificent. the world would have worshipped you and you would have borne my name. what are you now a third-rate actress with a pretty face. the girl grew white and trembled. she clenched her hands together and her voice seemed to catch in her throat. you are not serious dorian she murmured. you are acting. acting i leave that to you. you do it so well he answered bitterly. she rose from her knees and with a piteous expression of pain in her face came across the room to him. she put her hand upon his arm and looked into his eyes. he thrust her back. dont touch me he cried. a low moan broke from her and she flung herself at his feet and lay there like a trampled flower. dorian dorian dont leave me she whispered. i am so sorry i didnt act well. i was thinking of you all the time. but i will try—indeed i will try. it came so suddenly across me my love for you. i think i should never have known it if you had not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. kiss me again my love. dont go away from me. i couldnt bear it. oh dont go away from me. my brother ... no never mind. he didnt mean it. he was in jest.... but you oh cant you forgive me for to-night i will work so hard and try to improve. dont be cruel to me because i love you better than anything in the world. after all it is only once that i have not pleased you. but you are quite right dorian. i should have shown myself more of an artist. it was foolish of me and yet i couldnt help it. oh dont leave me dont leave me. a fit of passionate sobbing choked her. she crouched on the floor like a wounded thing and dorian gray with his beautiful eyes looked down at her and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain. there is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. sibyl vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. her tears and sobs annoyed him. i am going he said at last in his calm clear voice. i dont wish to be unkind but i cant see you again. you have disappointed me. she wept silently and made no answer but crept nearer. her little hands stretched blindly out and appeared to be seeking for him. he turned on his heel and left the room. in a few moments he was out of the theatre. where he went to he hardly knew. he remembered wandering through dimly lit streets past gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. drunkards had reeled by cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. he had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts. as the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to covent garden. the darkness lifted and flushed with faint fires the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons. a white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. he thanked him wondered why he refused to accept any money for them and began to eat them listlessly. they had been plucked at midnight and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips and of yellow and red roses defiled in front of him threading their way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables. under the portico with its grey sun-bleached pillars loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls waiting for the auction to be over. others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. the heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones shaking their bells and trappings. some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. iris-necked and pink-footed the pigeons ran about picking up seeds. after a little while he hailed a hansom and drove home. for a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep looking round at the silent square with its blank close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds. the sky was pure opal now and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. from some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising. it curled a violet riband through the nacre-coloured air. in the huge gilt venetian lantern spoil of some doges barge that hung from the ceiling of the great oak-panelled hall of entrance lights were still burning from three flickering jets thin blue petals of flame they seemed rimmed with white fire. he turned them out and having thrown his hat and cape on the table passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that in his new-born feeling for luxury he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at selby royal. as he was turning the handle of the door his eye fell upon the portrait basil hallward had painted of him. he started back as if in surprise. then he went on into his own room looking somewhat puzzled. after he had taken the button-hole out of his coat he seemed to hesitate. finally he came back went over to the picture and examined it. in the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds the face appeared to him to be a little changed. the expression looked different. one would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. it was certainly strange. he turned round and walking to the window drew up the blind. the bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners where they lay shuddering. but the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there to be more intensified even. the quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing. he winced and taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory cupids one of lord henrys many presents to him glanced hurriedly into its polished depths. no line like that warped his red lips. what did it mean he rubbed his eyes and came close to the picture and examined it again. there were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered. it was not a mere fancy of his own. the thing was horribly apparent. he threw himself into a chair and began to think. suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in basil hallwards studio the day the picture had been finished. yes he remembered it perfectly. he had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young and the portrait grow old that his own beauty might be untarnished and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. surely his wish had not been fulfilled such things were impossible. it seemed monstrous even to think of them. and yet there was the picture before him with the touch of cruelty in the mouth. cruelty had he been cruel it was the girls fault not his. he had dreamed of her as a great artist had given his love to her because he had thought her great. then she had disappointed him. she had been shallow and unworthy. and yet a feeling of infinite regret came over him as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child. he remembered with what callousness he had watched her. why had he been made like that why had such a soul been given to him but he had suffered also. during the three terrible hours that the play had lasted he had lived centuries of pain aeon upon aeon of torture. his life was well worth hers. she had marred him for a moment if he had wounded her for an age. besides women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. they lived on their emotions. they only thought of their emotions. when they took lovers it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes. lord henry had told him that and lord henry knew what women were. why should he trouble about sibyl vane she was nothing to him now. but the picture what was he to say of that it held the secret of his life and told his story. it had taught him to love his own beauty. would it teach him to loathe his own soul would he ever look at it again no it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. the horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad. the picture had not changed. it was folly to think so. yet it was watching him with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile. its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. its blue eyes met his own. a sense of infinite pity not for himself but for the painted image of himself came over him. it had altered already and would alter more. its gold would wither into grey. its red and white roses would die. for every sin that he committed a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. but he would not sin. the picture changed or unchanged would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. he would resist temptation. he would not see lord henry any more—would not at any rate listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallwards garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things. he would go back to sibyl vane make her amends marry her try to love her again. yes it was his duty to do so. she must have suffered more than he had. poor child he had been selfish and cruel to her. the fascination that she had exercised over him would return. they would be happy together. his life with her would be beautiful and pure. he got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait shuddering as he glanced at it. how horrible he murmured to himself and he walked across to the window and opened it. when he stepped out on to the grass he drew a deep breath. the fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. he thought only of sibyl. a faint echo of his love came back to him. he repeated her name over and over again. the birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her. chapter viii. it was long past noon when he awoke. his valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late. finally his bell sounded and victor came in softly with a cup of tea and a pile of letters on a small tray of old sevres china and drew back the olive-satin curtains with their shimmering blue lining that hung in front of the three tall windows. monsieur has well slept this morning he said smiling. what oclock is it victor asked dorian gray drowsily. one hour and a quarter monsieur. how late it was he sat up and having sipped some tea turned over his letters. one of them was from lord henry and had been brought by hand that morning. he hesitated for a moment and then put it aside. the others he opened listlessly. they contained the usual collection of cards invitations to dinner tickets for private views programmes of charity concerts and the like that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season. there was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver louis-quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities and there were several very courteously worded communications from jermyn street money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moments notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest. after about ten minutes he got up and throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool passed into the onyx-paved bathroom. the cool water refreshed him after his long sleep. he seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. a dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice but there was the unreality of a dream about it. as soon as he was dressed he went into the library and sat down to a light french breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window. it was an exquisite day. the warm air seemed laden with spices. a bee flew in and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that filled with sulphur-yellow roses stood before him. he felt perfectly happy. suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait and he started. too cold for monsieur asked his valet putting an omelette on the table. i shut the window dorian shook his head. i am not cold he murmured. was it all true had the portrait really changed or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy surely a painted canvas could not alter the thing was absurd. it would serve as a tale to tell basil some day. it would make him smile. and yet how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing first in the dim twilight and then in the bright dawn he had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lips. he almost dreaded his valet leaving the room. he knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait. he was afraid of certainty. when the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain. as the door was closing behind him he called him back. the man stood waiting for his orders. dorian looked at him for a moment. i am not at home to any one victor he said with a sigh. the man bowed and retired. then he rose from the table lit a cigarette and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. the screen was an old one of gilt spanish leather stamped and wrought with a rather florid louis-quatorze pattern. he scanned it curiously wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a mans life. should he move it aside after all why not let it stay there what was the use of knowing if the thing was true it was terrible. if it was not true why trouble about it but what if by some fate or deadlier chance eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change what should he do if basil hallward came and asked to look at his own picture basil would be sure to do that. no the thing had to be examined and at once. anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt. he got up and locked both doors. at least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame. then he drew the screen aside and saw himself face to face. it was perfectly true. the portrait had altered. as he often remembered afterwards and always with no small wonder he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest. that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him. and yet it was a fact. was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him could it be that what that soul thought they realized—that what it dreamed they made true or was there some other more terrible reason he shuddered and felt afraid and going back to the couch lay there gazing at the picture in sickened horror. one thing however he felt that it had done for him. it had made him conscious how unjust how cruel he had been to sibyl vane. it was not too late to make reparation for that. she could still be his wife. his unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence would be transformed into some nobler passion and the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life would be to him what holiness is to some and conscience to others and the fear of god to us all. there were opiates for remorse drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep. but here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin. here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls. three oclock struck and four and the half-hour rang its double chime but dorian gray did not stir. he was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering. he did not know what to do or what to think. finally he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. he covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. there is a luxury in self-reproach. when we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. it is the confession not the priest that gives us absolution. when dorian had finished the letter he felt that he had been forgiven. suddenly there came a knock to the door and he heard lord henrys voice outside. my dear boy i must see you. let me in at once. i cant bear your shutting yourself up like this. he made no answer at first but remained quite still. the knocking still continued and grew louder. yes it was better to let lord henry in and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel to part if parting was inevitable. he jumped up drew the screen hastily across the picture and unlocked the door. i am so sorry for it all dorian said lord henry as he entered. but you must not think too much about it. do you mean about sibyl vane asked the lad. yes of course answered lord henry sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves. it is dreadful from one point of view but it was not your fault. tell me did you go behind and see her after the play was over yes. i felt sure you had. did you make a scene with her i was brutal harry—perfectly brutal. but it is all right now. i am not sorry for anything that has happened. it has taught me to know myself better. ah dorian i am so glad you take it in that way i was afraid i would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours. i have got through all that said dorian shaking his head and smiling. i am perfectly happy now. i know what conscience is to begin with. it is not what you told me it was. it is the divinest thing in us. dont sneer at it harry any more—at least not before me. i want to be good. i cant bear the idea of my soul being hideous. a very charming artistic basis for ethics dorian i congratulate you on it. but how are you going to begin by marrying sibyl vane. marrying sibyl vane cried lord henry standing up and looking at him in perplexed amazement. but my dear dorian— yes harry i know what you are going to say. something dreadful about marriage. dont say it. dont ever say things of that kind to me again. two days ago i asked sibyl to marry me. i am not going to break my word to her. she is to be my wife. your wife dorian ... didnt you get my letter i wrote to you this morning and sent the note down by my own man. your letter oh yes i remember. i have not read it yet harry. i was afraid there might be something in it that i wouldnt like. you cut life to pieces with your epigrams. you know nothing then what do you mean lord henry walked across the room and sitting down by dorian gray took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. dorian he said my letter—dont be frightened—was to tell you that sibyl vane is dead. a cry of pain broke from the lads lips and he leaped to his feet tearing his hands away from lord henrys grasp. dead sibyl dead it is not true it is a horrible lie how dare you say it it is quite true dorian said lord henry gravely. it is in all the morning papers. i wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till i came. there will have to be an inquest of course and you must not be mixed up in it. things like that make a man fashionable in paris. but in london people are so prejudiced. here one should never make ones début with a scandal. one should reserve that to give an interest to ones old age. i suppose they dont know your name at the theatre if they dont it is all right. did any one see you going round to her room that is an important point. dorian did not answer for a few moments. he was dazed with horror. finally he stammered in a stifled voice harry did you say an inquest what did you mean by that did sibyl— oh harry i cant bear it but be quick. tell me everything at once. i have no doubt it was not an accident dorian though it must be put in that way to the public. it seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother about half-past twelve or so she said she had forgotten something upstairs. they waited some time for her but she did not come down again. they ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. she had swallowed something by mistake some dreadful thing they use at theatres. i dont know what it was but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. i should fancy it was prussic acid as she seems to have died instantaneously. harry harry it is terrible cried the lad. yes it is very tragic of course but you must not get yourself mixed up in it. i see by the standard that she was seventeen. i should have thought she was almost younger than that. she looked such a child and seemed to know so little about acting. dorian you mustnt let this thing get on your nerves. you must come and dine with me and afterwards we will look in at the opera. it is a patti night and everybody will be there. you can come to my sisters box. she has got some smart women with her. so i have murdered sibyl vane said dorian gray half to himself murdered her as surely as if i had cut her little throat with a knife. yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. the birds sing just as happily in my garden. and to-night i am to dine with you and then go on to the opera and sup somewhere i suppose afterwards. how extraordinarily dramatic life is if i had read all this in a book harry i think i would have wept over it. somehow now that it has happened actually and to me it seems far too wonderful for tears. here is the first passionate love-letter i have ever written in my life. strange that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl. can they feel i wonder those white silent people we call the dead sibyl can she feel or know or listen oh harry how i loved her once it seems years ago to me now. she was everything to me. then came that dreadful night—was it really only last night—when she played so badly and my heart almost broke. she explained it all to me. it was terribly pathetic. but i was not moved a bit. i thought her shallow. suddenly something happened that made me afraid. i cant tell you what it was but it was terrible. i said i would go back to her. i felt i had done wrong. and now she is dead. my god my god harry what shall i do you dont know the danger i am in and there is nothing to keep me straight. she would have done that for me. she had no right to kill herself. it was selfish of her. my dear dorian answered lord henry taking a cigarette from his case and producing a gold-latten matchbox the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life. if you had married this girl you would have been wretched. of course you would have treated her kindly. one can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. but she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. and when a woman finds that out about her husband she either becomes dreadfully dowdy or wears very smart bonnets that some other womans husband has to pay for. i say nothing about the social mistake which would have been abject—which of course i would not have allowed—but i assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure. i suppose it would muttered the lad walking up and down the room and looking horribly pale. but i thought it was my duty. it is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right. i remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions—that they are always made too late. mine certainly were. good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. their origin is pure vanity. their result is absolutely nil. they give us now and then some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. that is all that can be said for them. they are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account. harry cried dorian gray coming over and sitting down beside him why is it that i cannot feel this tragedy as much as i want to i dont think i am heartless. do you you have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name dorian answered lord henry with his sweet melancholy smile. the lad frowned. i dont like that explanation harry he rejoined but i am glad you dont think i am heartless. i am nothing of the kind. i know i am not. and yet i must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should. it seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. it has all the terrible beauty of a greek tragedy a tragedy in which i took a great part but by which i have not been wounded. it is an interesting question said lord henry who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lads unconscious egotism an extremely interesting question. i fancy that the true explanation is this it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence their absolute incoherence their absurd want of meaning their entire lack of style. they affect us just as vulgarity affects us. they give us an impression of sheer brute force and we revolt against that. sometimes however a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. if these elements of beauty are real the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors but the spectators of the play. or rather we are both. we watch ourselves and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. in the present case what is it that has really happened some one has killed herself for love of you. i wish that i had ever had such an experience. it would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. the people who have adored me—there have not been very many but there have been some—have always insisted on living on long after i had ceased to care for them or they to care for me. they have become stout and tedious and when i meet them they go in at once for reminiscences. that awful memory of woman what a fearful thing it is and what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals one should absorb the colour of life but one should never remember its details. details are always vulgar. i must sow poppies in my garden sighed dorian. there is no necessity rejoined his companion. life has always poppies in her hands. of course now and then things linger. i once wore nothing but violets all through one season as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die. ultimately however it did die. i forget what killed it. i think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. that is always a dreadful moment. it fills one with the terror of eternity. well—would you believe it—a week ago at lady hampshires i found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question and she insisted on going over the whole thing again and digging up the past and raking up the future. i had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel. she dragged it out again and assured me that i had spoiled her life. i am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner so i did not feel any anxiety. but what a lack of taste she showed the one charm of the past is that it is the past. but women never know when the curtain has fallen. they always want a sixth act and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it. if they were allowed their own way every comedy would have a tragic ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. they are charmingly artificial but they have no sense of art. you are more fortunate than i am. i assure you dorian that not one of the women i have known would have done for me what sibyl vane did for you. ordinary women always console themselves. some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours. never trust a woman who wears mauve whatever her age may be or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. it always means that they have a history. others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. they flaunt their conjugal felicity in ones face as if it were the most fascinating of sins. religion consoles some. its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation a woman once told me and i can quite understand it. besides nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. conscience makes egotists of us all. yes there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. indeed i have not mentioned the most important one. what is that harry said the lad listlessly. oh the obvious consolation. taking some one elses admirer when one loses ones own. in good society that always whitewashes a woman. but really dorian how different sibyl vane must have been from all the women one meets there is something to me quite beautiful about her death. i am glad i am living in a century when such wonders happen. they make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with such as romance passion and love. i was terribly cruel to her. you forget that. i am afraid that women appreciate cruelty downright cruelty more than anything else. they have wonderfully primitive instincts. we have emancipated them but they remain slaves looking for their masters all the same. they love being dominated. i am sure you were splendid. i have never seen you really and absolutely angry but i can fancy how delightful you looked. and after all you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful but that i see now was absolutely true and it holds the key to everything. what was that harry you said to me that sibyl vane represented to you all the heroines of romance—that she was desdemona one night and ophelia the other that if she died as juliet she came to life as imogen. she will never come to life again now muttered the lad burying his face in his hands. no she will never come to life. she has played her last part. but you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some jacobean tragedy as a wonderful scene from webster or ford or cyril tourneur. the girl never really lived and so she has never really died. to you at least she was always a dream a phantom that flitted through shakespeares plays and left them lovelier for its presence a reed through which shakespeares music sounded richer and more full of joy. the moment she touched actual life she marred it and it marred her and so she passed away. mourn for ophelia if you like. put ashes on your head because cordelia was strangled. cry out against heaven because the daughter of brabantio died. but dont waste your tears over sibyl vane. she was less real than they are. there was a silence. the evening darkened in the room. noiselessly and with silver feet the shadows crept in from the garden. the colours faded wearily out of things. after some time dorian gray looked up. you have explained me to myself harry he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. i felt all that you have said but somehow i was afraid of it and i could not express it to myself. how well you know me but we will not talk again of what has happened. it has been a marvellous experience. that is all. i wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous. life has everything in store for you dorian. there is nothing that you with your extraordinary good looks will not be able to do. but suppose harry i became haggard and old and wrinkled what then ah then said lord henry rising to go then my dear dorian you would have to fight for your victories. as it is they are brought to you. no you must keep your good looks. we live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too much to be beautiful. we cannot spare you. and now you had better dress and drive down to the club. we are rather late as it is. i think i shall join you at the opera harry. i feel too tired to eat anything. what is the number of your sisters box twenty-seven i believe. it is on the grand tier. you will see her name on the door. but i am sorry you wont come and dine. i dont feel up to it said dorian listlessly. but i am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. you are certainly my best friend. no one has ever understood me as you have. we are only at the beginning of our friendship dorian answered lord henry shaking him by the hand. good-bye. i shall see you before nine-thirty i hope. remember patti is singing. as he closed the door behind him dorian gray touched the bell and in a few minutes victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down. he waited impatiently for him to go. the man seemed to take an interminable time over everything. as soon as he had left he rushed to the screen and drew it back. no there was no further change in the picture. it had received the news of sibyl vanes death before he had known of it himself. it was conscious of the events of life as they occurred. the vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had no doubt appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison whatever it was. or was it indifferent to results did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul he wondered and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes shuddering as he hoped it. poor sibyl what a romance it had all been she had often mimicked death on the stage. then death himself had touched her and taken her with him. how had she played that dreadful last scene had she cursed him as she died no she had died for love of him and love would always be a sacrament to him now. she had atoned for everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life. he would not think any more of what she had made him go through on that horrible night at the theatre. when he thought of her it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the worlds stage to show the supreme reality of love. a wonderful tragic figure tears came to his eyes as he remembered her childlike look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace. he brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture. he felt that the time had really come for making his choice. or had his choice already been made yes life had decided that for him—life and his own infinite curiosity about life. eternal youth infinite passion pleasures subtle and secret wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have all these things. the portrait was to bear the burden of his shame that was all. a feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas. once in boyish mockery of narcissus he had kissed or feigned to kiss those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty almost enamoured of it as it seemed to him at times. was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing to be hidden away in a locked room to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair the pity of it the pity of it for a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease. it had changed in answer to a prayer perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. and yet who that knew anything about life would surrender the chance of remaining always young however fantastic that chance might be or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught besides was it really under his control had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all if thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things nay without thought or conscious desire might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity but the reason was of no importance. he would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. if the picture was to alter it was to alter. that was all. why inquire too closely into it for there would be a real pleasure in watching it. he would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. as it had revealed to him his own body so it would reveal to him his own soul. and when winter came upon it he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer. when the blood crept from its face and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes he would keep the glamour of boyhood. not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. like the gods of the greeks he would be strong and fleet and joyous. what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas he would be safe. that was everything. he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture smiling as he did so and passed into his bedroom where his valet was already waiting for him. an hour later he was at the opera and lord henry was leaning over his chair. chapter ix. as he was sitting at breakfast next morning basil hallward was shown into the room. i am so glad i have found you dorian he said gravely. i called last night and they told me you were at the opera. of course i knew that was impossible. but i wish you had left word where you had really gone to. i passed a dreadful evening half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another. i think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first. i read of it quite by chance in a late edition of the globe that i picked up at the club. i came here at once and was miserable at not finding you. i cant tell you how heart-broken i am about the whole thing. i know what you must suffer. but where were you did you go down and see the girls mother for a moment i thought of following you there. they gave the address in the paper. somewhere in the euston road isnt it but i was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that i could not lighten. poor woman what a state she must be in and her only child too what did she say about it all my dear basil how do i know murmured dorian gray sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored. i was at the opera. you should have come on there. i met lady gwendolen harrys sister for the first time. we were in her box. she is perfectly charming and patti sang divinely. dont talk about horrid subjects. if one doesnt talk about a thing it has never happened. it is simply expression as harry says that gives reality to things. i may mention that she was not the womans only child. there is a son a charming fellow i believe. but he is not on the stage. he is a sailor or something. and now tell me about yourself and what you are painting. you went to the opera said hallward speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice. you went to the opera while sibyl vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging you can talk to me of other women being charming and of patti singing divinely before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in why man there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers stop basil i wont hear it cried dorian leaping to his feet. you must not tell me about things. what is done is done. what is past is past. you call yesterday the past what has the actual lapse of time got to do with it it is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. a man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. i dont want to be at the mercy of my emotions. i want to use them to enjoy them and to dominate them. dorian this is horrible something has changed you completely. you look exactly the same wonderful boy who day after day used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. but you were simple natural and affectionate then. you were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. now i dont know what has come over you. you talk as if you had no heart no pity in you. it is all harrys influence. i see that. the lad flushed up and going to the window looked out for a few moments on the green flickering sun-lashed garden. i owe a great deal to harry basil he said at last more than i owe to you. you only taught me to be vain. well i am punished for that dorian—or shall be some day. i dont know what you mean basil he exclaimed turning round. i dont know what you want. what do you want i want the dorian gray i used to paint said the artist sadly. basil said the lad going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder you have come too late. yesterday when i heard that sibyl vane had killed herself— killed herself good heavens is there no doubt about that cried hallward looking up at him with an expression of horror. my dear basil surely you dont think it was a vulgar accident of course she killed herself. the elder man buried his face in his hands. how fearful he muttered and a shudder ran through him. no said dorian gray there is nothing fearful about it. it is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. as a rule people who act lead the most commonplace lives. they are good husbands or faithful wives or something tedious. you know what i mean—middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing. how different sibyl was she lived her finest tragedy. she was always a heroine. the last night she played—the night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. when she knew its unreality she died as juliet might have died. she passed again into the sphere of art. there is something of the martyr about her. her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom all its wasted beauty. but as i was saying you must not think i have not suffered. if you had come in yesterday at a particular moment—about half-past five perhaps or a quarter to six—you would have found me in tears. even harry who was here who brought me the news in fact had no idea what i was going through. i suffered immensely. then it passed away. i cannot repeat an emotion. no one can except sentimentalists. and you are awfully unjust basil. you come down here to console me. that is charming of you. you find me consoled and you are furious. how like a sympathetic person you remind me of a story harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed or some unjust law altered—i forget exactly what it was. finally he succeeded and nothing could exceed his disappointment. he had absolutely nothing to do almost died of ennui and became a confirmed misanthrope. and besides my dear old basil if you really want to console me teach me rather to forget what has happened or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts i remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. well i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. old brocades green bronzes lacquer-work carved ivories exquisite surroundings luxury pomp—there is much to be got from all these. but the artistic temperament that they create or at any rate reveal is still more to me. to become the spectator of ones own life as harry says is to escape the suffering of life. i know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. you have not realized how i have developed. i was a schoolboy when you knew me. i am a man now. i have new passions new thoughts new ideas. i am different but you must not like me less. i am changed but you must always be my friend. of course i am very fond of harry. but i know that you are better than he is. you are not stronger—you are too much afraid of life—but you are better. and how happy we used to be together dont leave me basil and dont quarrel with me. i am what i am. there is nothing more to be said. the painter felt strangely moved. the lad was infinitely dear to him and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. he could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. after all his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. there was so much in him that was good so much in him that was noble. well dorian he said at length with a sad smile i wont speak to you again about this horrible thing after to-day. i only trust your name wont be mentioned in connection with it. the inquest is to take place this afternoon. have they summoned you dorian shook his head and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word inquest. there was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind. they dont know my name he answered. but surely she did only my christian name and that i am quite sure she never mentioned to any one. she told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who i was and that she invariably told them my name was prince charming. it was pretty of her. you must do me a drawing of sibyl basil. i should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words. i will try and do something dorian if it would please you. but you must come and sit to me yourself again. i cant get on without you. i can never sit to you again basil. it is impossible he exclaimed starting back. the painter stared at him. my dear boy what nonsense he cried. do you mean to say you dont like what i did of you where is it why have you pulled the screen in front of it let me look at it. it is the best thing i have ever done. do take the screen away dorian. it is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. i felt the room looked different as i came in. my servant has nothing to do with it basil. you dont imagine i let him arrange my room for me he settles my flowers for me sometimes—that is all. no i did it myself. the light was too strong on the portrait. too strong surely not my dear fellow it is an admirable place for it. let me see it. and hallward walked towards the corner of the room. a cry of terror broke from dorian grays lips and he rushed between the painter and the screen. basil he said looking very pale you must not look at it. i dont wish you to. not look at my own work you are not serious. why shouldnt i look at it exclaimed hallward laughing. if you try to look at it basil on my word of honour i will never speak to you again as long as i live. i am quite serious. i dont offer any explanation and you are not to ask for any. but remember if you touch this screen everything is over between us. hallward was thunderstruck. he looked at dorian gray in absolute amazement. he had never seen him like this before. the lad was actually pallid with rage. his hands were clenched and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. he was trembling all over. dorian dont speak but what is the matter of course i wont look at it if you dont want me to he said rather coldly turning on his heel and going over towards the window. but really it seems rather absurd that i shouldnt see my own work especially as i am going to exhibit it in paris in the autumn. i shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that so i must see it some day and why not to-day to exhibit it you want to exhibit it exclaimed dorian gray a strange sense of terror creeping over him. was the world going to be shown his secret were people to gape at the mystery of his life that was impossible. something—he did not know what—had to be done at once. yes i dont suppose you will object to that. georges petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the rue de sèze which will open the first week in october. the portrait will only be away a month. i should think you could easily spare it for that time. in fact you are sure to be out of town. and if you keep it always behind a screen you cant care much about it. dorian gray passed his hand over his forehead. there were beads of perspiration there. he felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger. you told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it he cried. why have you changed your mind you people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have. the only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless. you cant have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition. you told harry exactly the same thing. he stopped suddenly and a gleam of light came into his eyes. he remembered that lord henry had said to him once half seriously and half in jest if you want to have a strange quarter of an hour get basil to tell you why he wont exhibit your picture. he told me why he wouldnt and it was a revelation to me. yes perhaps basil too had his secret. he would ask him and try. basil he said coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face we have each of us a secret. let me know yours and i shall tell you mine. what was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture the painter shuddered in spite of himself. dorian if i told you you might like me less than you do and you would certainly laugh at me. i could not bear your doing either of those two things. if you wish me never to look at your picture again i am content. i have always you to look at. if you wish the best work i have ever done to be hidden from the world i am satisfied. your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation. no basil you must tell me insisted dorian gray. i think i have a right to know. his feeling of terror had passed away and curiosity had taken its place. he was determined to find out basil hallwards mystery. let us sit down dorian said the painter looking troubled. let us sit down. and just answer me one question. have you noticed in the picture something curious—something that probably at first did not strike you but that revealed itself to you suddenly basil cried the lad clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes. i see you did. dont speak. wait till you hear what i have to say. dorian from the moment i met you your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. i was dominated soul brain and power by you. you became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. i worshipped you. i grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. i wanted to have you all to myself. i was only happy when i was with you. when you were away from me you were still present in my art.... of course i never let you know anything about this. it would have been impossible. you would not have understood it. i hardly understood it myself. i only knew that i had seen perfection face to face and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful perhaps for in such mad worships there is peril the peril of losing them no less than the peril of keeping them.... weeks and weeks went on and i grew more and more absorbed in you. then came a new development. i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour and as adonis with huntsmans cloak and polished boar-spear. crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrians barge gazing across the green turbid nile. you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the waters silent silver the marvel of your own face. and it had all been what art should be—unconscious ideal and remote. one day a fatal day i sometimes think i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are not in the costume of dead ages but in your own dress and in your own time. whether it was the realism of the method or the mere wonder of your own personality thus directly presented to me without mist or veil i cannot tell. but i know that as i worked at it every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. i grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. i felt dorian that i had told too much that i had put too much of myself into it. then it was that i resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. you were a little annoyed but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. harry to whom i talked about it laughed at me. but i did not mind that. when the picture was finished and i sat alone with it i felt that i was right.... well after a few days the thing left my studio and as soon as i had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that i had been foolish in imagining that i had seen anything in it more than that you were extremely good-looking and that i could paint. even now i cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates. art is always more abstract than we fancy. form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all. it often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him. and so when i got this offer from paris i determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. it never occurred to me that you would refuse. i see now that you were right. the picture cannot be shown. you must not be angry with me dorian for what i have told you. as i said to harry once you are made to be worshipped. dorian gray drew a long breath. the colour came back to his cheeks and a smile played about his lips. the peril was over. he was safe for the time. yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous. but that was all. he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry was that one of the things that life had in store it is extraordinary to me dorian said hallward that you should have seen this in the portrait. did you really see it i saw something in it he answered something that seemed to me very curious. well you dont mind my looking at the thing now dorian shook his head. you must not ask me that basil. i could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture. you will some day surely never. well perhaps you are right. and now good-bye dorian. you have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. whatever i have done that is good i owe to you. ah you dont know what it cost me to tell you all that i have told you. my dear basil said dorian what have you told me simply that you felt that you admired me too much. that is not even a compliment. it was not intended as a compliment. it was a confession. now that i have made it something seems to have gone out of me. perhaps one should never put ones worship into words. it was a very disappointing confession. why what did you expect dorian you didnt see anything else in the picture did you there was nothing else to see no there was nothing else to see. why do you ask but you mustnt talk about worship. it is foolish. you and i are friends basil and we must always remain so. you have got harry said the painter sadly. oh harry cried the lad with a ripple of laughter. harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable. just the sort of life i would like to lead. but still i dont think i would go to harry if i were in trouble. i would sooner go to you basil. you will sit to me again impossible you spoil my life as an artist by refusing dorian. no man comes across two ideal things. few come across one. i cant explain it to you basil but i must never sit to you again. there is something fatal about a portrait. it has a life of its own. i will come and have tea with you. that will be just as pleasant. pleasanter for you i am afraid murmured hallward regretfully. and now good-bye. i am sorry you wont let me look at the picture once again. but that cant be helped. i quite understand what you feel about it. as he left the room dorian gray smiled to himself. poor basil how little he knew of the true reason and how strange it was that instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret he had succeeded almost by chance in wresting a secret from his friend how much that strange confession explained to him the painters absurd fits of jealousy his wild devotion his extravagant panegyrics his curious reticences—he understood them all now and he felt sorry. there seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance. he sighed and touched the bell. the portrait must be hidden away at all costs. he could not run such a risk of discovery again. it had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain even for an hour in a room to which any of his friends had access. chapter x. when his servant entered he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen. the man was quite impassive and waited for his orders. dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it. he could see the reflection of victors face perfectly. it was like a placid mask of servility. there was nothing to be afraid of there. yet he thought it best to be on his guard. speaking very slowly he told him to tell the house-keeper that he wanted to see her and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once. it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. or was that merely his own fancy after a few moments in her black silk dress with old-fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled hands leaf bustled into the library. he asked her for the key of the schoolroom. the old schoolroom dorian she exclaimed. why it is full of dust. i must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. it is not fit for you to see sir. it is not indeed. i dont want it put straight leaf. i only want the key. well sir youll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. why it hasnt been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died. he winced at the mention of his grandfather. he had hateful memories of him. that does not matter he answered. i simply want to see the place—that is all. give me the key. and here is the key sir said the old lady going over the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. here is the key. ill have it off the bunch in a moment. but you dont think of living up there sir and you so comfortable here no no he cried petulantly. thank you leaf. that will do. she lingered for a few moments and was garrulous over some detail of the household. he sighed and told her to manage things as she thought best. she left the room wreathed in smiles. as the door closed dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round the room. his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near bologna. yes that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. it had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead. now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own worse than the corruption of death itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. what the worm was to the corpse his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. they would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. they would defile it and make it shameful. and yet the thing would still live on. it would be always alive. he shuddered and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. basil would have helped him to resist lord henrys influence and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. the love that he bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual. it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. it was such love as michelangelo had known and montaigne and winckelmann and shakespeare himself. yes basil could have saved him. but it was too late now. the past could always be annihilated. regret denial or forgetfulness could do that. but the future was inevitable. there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real. he took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it and holding it in his hands passed behind the screen. was the face on the canvas viler than before it seemed to him that it was unchanged and yet his loathing of it was intensified. gold hair blue eyes and rose-red lips—they all were there. it was simply the expression that had altered. that was horrible in its cruelty. compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke how shallow basils reproaches about sibyl vane had been—how shallow and of what little account his own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and calling him to judgement. a look of pain came across him and he flung the rich pall over the picture. as he did so a knock came to the door. he passed out as his servant entered. the persons are here monsieur. he felt that the man must be got rid of at once. he must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. there was something sly about him and he had thoughtful treacherous eyes. sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to lord henry asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening. wait for an answer he said handing it to him and show the men in here. in two or three minutes there was another knock and hubbard himself the celebrated frame-maker of south audley street came in with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. hubbard was a florid red-whiskered little man whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him. as a rule he never left his shop. he waited for people to come to him. but he always made an exception in favour of dorian gray. there was something about dorian that charmed everybody. it was a pleasure even to see him. what can i do for you gray he said rubbing his fat freckled hands. i thought i would do myself the honour of coming round in person. i have just got a beauty of a frame sir. picked it up at a sale. old florentine. came from fonthill i believe. admirably suited for a religious subject gray. i am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round hubbard. i shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though i dont go in much at present for religious art—but to-day i only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me. it is rather heavy so i thought i would ask you to lend me a couple of your men. no trouble at all gray. i am delighted to be of any service to you. which is the work of art sir this replied dorian moving the screen back. can you move it covering and all just as it is i dont want it to get scratched going upstairs. there will be no difficulty sir said the genial frame-maker beginning with the aid of his assistant to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended. and now where shall we carry it to gray i will show you the way hubbard if you will kindly follow me. or perhaps you had better go in front. i am afraid it is right at the top of the house. we will go up by the front staircase as it is wider. he held the door open for them and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent. the elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky and now and then in spite of the obsequious protests of hubbard who had the true tradesmans spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful dorian put his hand to it so as to help them. something of a load to carry sir gasped the little man when they reached the top landing. and he wiped his shiny forehead. i am afraid it is rather heavy murmured dorian as he unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men. he had not entered the place for more than four years—not indeed since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child and then as a study when he grew somewhat older. it was a large well-proportioned room which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom for his strange likeness to his mother and also for other reasons he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance. it appeared to dorian to have but little changed. there was the huge italian cassone with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy. there the satinwood book-case filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks. on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden while a company of hawkers rode by carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists. how well he remembered it all every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away. how little he had thought in those dead days of all that was in store for him but there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this. he had the key and no one else could enter it. beneath its purple pall the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial sodden and unclean. what did it matter no one could see it. he himself would not see it. why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul he kept his youth—that was enough. and besides might not his nature grow finer after all there was no reason that the future should be so full of shame. some love might come across his life and purify him and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm. perhaps some day the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth and he might show to the world basil hallwards masterpiece. no that was impossible. hour by hour and week by week the thing upon the canvas was growing old. it might escape the hideousness of sin but the hideousness of age was in store for it. the cheeks would become hollow or flaccid. yellow crows feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible. the hair would lose its brightness the mouth would gape or droop would be foolish or gross as the mouths of old men are. there would be the wrinkled throat the cold blue-veined hands the twisted body that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood. the picture had to be concealed. there was no help for it. bring it in hubbard please he said wearily turning round. i am sorry i kept you so long. i was thinking of something else. always glad to have a rest gray answered the frame-maker who was still gasping for breath. where shall we put it sir oh anywhere. here this will do. i dont want to have it hung up. just lean it against the wall. thanks. might one look at the work of art sir dorian started. it would not interest you hubbard he said keeping his eye on the man. he felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life. i shant trouble you any more now. i am much obliged for your kindness in coming round. not at all not at all gray. ever ready to do anything for you sir. and hubbard tramped downstairs followed by the assistant who glanced back at dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face. he had never seen any one so marvellous. when the sound of their footsteps had died away dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket. he felt safe now. no one would ever look upon the horrible thing. no eye but his would ever see his shame. on reaching the library he found that it was just after five oclock and that the tea had been already brought up. on a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre a present from lady radley his guardians wife a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in cairo was lying a note from lord henry and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. a copy of the third edition of the st. jamess gazette had been placed on the tea-tray. it was evident that victor had returned. he wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing. he would be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already while he had been laying the tea-things. the screen had not been set back and a blank space was visible on the wall. perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room. it was a horrible thing to have a spy in ones house. he had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter or overheard a conversation or picked up a card with an address or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace. he sighed and having poured himself out some tea opened lord henrys note. it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper and a book that might interest him and that he would be at the club at eight-fifteen. he opened the st. jamess languidly and looked through it. a red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. it drew attention to the following paragraph inquest on an actress.—an inquest was held this morning at the bell tavern hoxton road by danby the district coroner on the body of sibyl vane a young actress recently engaged at the royal theatre holborn. a verdict of death by misadventure was returned. considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence and that of dr. birrell who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased. he frowned and tearing the paper in two went across the room and flung the pieces away. how ugly it all was and how horribly real ugliness made things he felt a little annoyed with lord henry for having sent him the report. and it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil. victor might have read it. the man knew more than enough english for that. perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. and yet what did it matter what had dorian gray to do with sibyl vanes death there was nothing to fear. dorian gray had not killed her. his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him. what was it he wondered. he went towards the little pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver and taking up the volume flung himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. after a few minutes he became absorbed. it was the strangest book that he had ever read. it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment and to the delicate sound of flutes the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him. things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him. things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed. it was a novel without a plot and with only one character being indeed simply a psychological study of a certain young parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own and to sum up as it were in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. the style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style vivid and obscure at once full of argot and of archaisms of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the french school of symbolistes. there were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour. the life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy. one hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner. it was a poisonous book. the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. the mere cadence of the sentences the subtle monotony of their music so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated produced in the mind of the lad as he passed from chapter to chapter a form of reverie a malady of dreaming that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows. cloudless and pierced by one solitary star a copper-green sky gleamed through the windows. he read on by its wan light till he could read no more. then after his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour he got up and going into the next room placed the book on the little florentine table that always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner. it was almost nine oclock before he reached the club where he found lord henry sitting alone in the morning-room looking very much bored. i am so sorry harry he cried but really it is entirely your fault. that book you sent me so fascinated me that i forgot how the time was going. yes i thought you would like it replied his host rising from his chair. i didnt say i liked it harry. i said it fascinated me. there is a great difference. ah you have discovered that murmured lord henry. and they passed into the dining-room. chapter xi. for years dorian gray could not free himself from the influence of this book. or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it. he procured from paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition and had them bound in different colours so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed at times to have almost entirely lost control. the hero the wonderful young parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. and indeed the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life written before he had lived it. in one point he was more fortunate than the novels fantastic hero. he never knew—never indeed had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors and polished metal surfaces and still water which came upon the young parisian so early in his life and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once apparently been so remarkable. it was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every joy as certainly in every pleasure cruelty has its place—that he used to read the latter part of the book with its really tragic if somewhat overemphasized account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others and the world he had most dearly valued. for the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated basil hallward and many others besides him seemed never to leave him. even those who had heard the most evil things against him—and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through london and became the chatter of the clubs—could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him. he had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world. men who talked grossly became silent when dorian gray entered the room. there was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them. his mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. they wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual. often on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends or thought that they were so he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room open the door with the key that never left him now and stand with a mirror in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass. the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. he would examine with minute care and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth wondering sometimes which were the more horrible the signs of sin or the signs of age. he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture and smile. he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs. there were moments indeed at night when lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which under an assumed name and in disguise it was his habit to frequent he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish. but moments such as these were rare. that curiosity about life which lord henry had first stirred in him as they sat together in the garden of their friend seemed to increase with gratification. the more he knew the more he desired to know. he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them. yet he was not really reckless at any rate in his relations to society. once or twice every month during the winter and on each wednesday evening while the season lasted he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. his little dinners in the settling of which lord henry always assisted him were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers and embroidered cloths and antique plate of gold and silver. indeed there were many especially among the very young men who saw or fancied that they saw in dorian gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in eton or oxford days a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world. to them he seemed to be of the company of those whom dante describes as having sought to make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty. like gautier he was one for whom the visible world existed. and certainly to him life itself was the first the greatest of the arts and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation. fashion by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal and dandyism which in its own way is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty had of course their fascination for him. his mode of dressing and the particular styles that from time to time he affected had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the mayfair balls and pall mall club windows who copied him in everything that he did and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful though to him only half-serious fopperies. for while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age and found indeed a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the london of his own day what to imperial neronian rome the author of the satyricon once had been yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel or the knotting of a necktie or the conduct of a cane. he sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization. the worship of the senses has often and with much justice been decried men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. but it appeared to dorian gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. as he looked back upon man moving through history he was haunted by a feeling of loss. so much had been surrendered and to such little purpose there had been mad wilful rejections monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which in their ignorance they had sought to escape nature in her wonderful irony driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions. yes there was to be as lord henry had prophesied a new hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having in our own day its curious revival. it was to have its service of the intellect certainly yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. its aim indeed was to be experience itself and not the fruits of experience sweet or bitter as they might be. of the asceticism that deadens the senses as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them it was to know nothing. but it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment. there are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques and that lends to gothic art its enduring vitality this art being one might fancy especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. gradually white fingers creep through the curtains and they appear to tremble. in black fantastic shapes dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. outside there is the stirring of birds among the leaves or the sound of men going forth to their work or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave. veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. the wan mirrors get back their mimic life. the flameless tapers stand where we had left them and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball or the letter that we had been afraid to read or that we had read too often. nothing seems to us changed. out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. we have to resume it where we had left off and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits or a wild longing it may be that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours and be changed or have other secrets a world in which the past would have little or no place or survive at any rate in no conscious form of obligation or regret the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain. it was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to dorian gray to be the true object or amongst the true objects of life and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature abandon himself to their subtle influences and then having as it were caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament and that indeed according to certain modern psychologists is often a condition of it. it was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the roman catholic communion and certainly the roman ritual had always a great attraction for him. the daily sacrifice more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize. he loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest in his stiff flowered dalmatic slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle or raising aloft the jewelled lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times one would fain think is indeed the panis cælestis the bread of angels or robed in the garments of the passion of christ breaking the host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins. the fuming censers that the grave boys in their lace and scarlet tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him. as he passed out he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives. but he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system or of mistaking for a house in which to live an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail. mysticism with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it moved him for a season and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the darwinismus movement in germany and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain or some white nerve in the body delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions morbid or healthy normal or diseased. yet as has been said of him before no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself. he felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. he knew that the senses no less than the soul have their spiritual mysteries to reveal. and so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the east. he saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life and set himself to discover their true relations wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical and in ambergris that stirred ones passions and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances and in musk that troubled the brain and in champak that stained the imagination and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented pollen-laden flowers of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods of spikenard that sickens of hovenia that makes men mad and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul. at another time he devoted himself entirely to music and in a long latticed room with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers or grave yellow-shawled tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes while grinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and crouching upon scarlet mats slim turbaned indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders. the harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when schuberts grace and chopins beautiful sorrows and the mighty harmonies of beethoven himself fell unheeded on his ear. he collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with western civilizations and loved to touch and try them. he had the mysterious juruparis of the rio negro indians that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging and the earthen jars of the peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds and flutes of human bones such as alfonso de ovalle heard in chile and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness. he had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken the long clarin of the mexicans into which the performer does not blow but through which he inhales the air the harsh ture of the amazon tribes that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees and can be heard it is said at a distance of three leagues the teponaztli that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants the yotl-bells of the aztecs that are hung in clusters like grapes and a huge cylindrical drum covered with the skins of great serpents like the one that bernal diaz saw when he went with cortes into the mexican temple and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description. the fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art like nature has her monsters things of bestial shape and with hideous voices. yet after some time he wearied of them and would sit in his box at the opera either alone or with lord henry listening in rapt pleasure to tannhauser and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul. on one occasion he took up the study of jewels and appeared at a costume ball as anne de joyeuse admiral of france in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls. this taste enthralled him for years and indeed may be said never to have left him. he would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver the pistachio-coloured peridot rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four-rayed stars flame-red cinnamon-stones orange and violet spinels and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. he loved the red gold of the sunstone and the moonstones pearly whiteness and the broken rainbow of the milky opal. he procured from amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs. he discovered wonderful stories also about jewels. in alphonsos clericalis disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth and in the romantic history of alexander the conqueror of emathia was said to have found in the vale of jordan snakes with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs. there was a gem in the brain of the dragon philostratus told us and by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain. according to the great alchemist pierre de boniface the diamond rendered a man invisible and the agate of india made him eloquent. the cornelian appeased anger and the hyacinth provoked sleep and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. the garnet cast out demons and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour. the selenite waxed and waned with the moon and the meloceus that discovers thieves could be affected only by the blood of kids. leonardus camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad that was a certain antidote against poison. the bezoar that was found in the heart of the arabian deer was a charm that could cure the plague. in the nests of arabian birds was the aspilates that according to democritus kept the wearer from any danger by fire. the king of ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand as the ceremony of his coronation. the gates of the palace of john the priest were made of sardius with the horn of the horned snake inwrought so that no man might bring poison within. over the gable were two golden apples in which were two carbuncles so that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. in lodges strange romance ‘a margarite of america it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one could behold all the chaste ladies of the world inchased out of silver looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites carbuncles sapphires and greene emeraults. marco polo had seen the inhabitants of zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead. a sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to king perozes and had slain the thief and mourned for seven moons over its loss. when the huns lured the king into the great pit he flung it away—procopius tells the story—nor was it ever found again though the emperor anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it. the king of malabar had shown to a certain venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls one for every god that he worshipped. when the duke de valentinois son of alexander vi. visited louis xii. of france his horse was loaded with gold leaves according to brantome and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light. charles of england had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds. richard ii had a coat valued at thirty thousand marks which was covered with balas rubies. hall described henry viii. on his way to the tower previous to his coronation as wearing a jacket of raised gold the placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses. the favourites of james i wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane. edward ii gave to piers gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with jacinths a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones and a skull-cap parsemé with pearls. henry ii. wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. the ducal hat of charles the rash the last duke of burgundy of his race was hung with pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires. how exquisite life had once been how gorgeous in its pomp and decoration even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful. then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe. as he investigated the subject—and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. he at any rate had escaped that. summer followed summer and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame but he was unchanged. no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom. how different it was with material things where had they passed to where was the great crocus-coloured robe on which the gods fought against the giants that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white gilt-reined steeds he longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the priest of the sun on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast the mortuary cloth of king chilperic with its three hundred golden bees the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with lions panthers bears dogs forests rocks hunters—all in fact that a painter can copy from nature and the coat that charles of orleans once wore on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning madame je suis tout joyeux the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread and each note of square shape in those days formed with four pearls. he read of the room that was prepared at the palace at rheims for the use of queen joan of burgundy and was decorated with thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots made in broidery and blazoned with the kings arms and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen the whole worked in gold. catherine de medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns. its curtains were of damask with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queens devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver. louis xiv. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment. the state bed of sobieski king of poland was made of smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the koran. its supports were of silver gilt beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. it had been taken from the turkish camp before vienna and the standard of mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy. and so for a whole year he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work getting the dainty delhi muslins finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles wings the dacca gauzes that from their transparency are known in the east as woven air and running water and evening dew strange figured cloths from java elaborate yellow chinese hangings books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with fleurs-de-lis birds and images veils of lacis worked in hungary point sicilian brocades and stiff spanish velvets georgian work with its gilt coins and japanese foukousas with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds. he had a special passion also for ecclesiastical vestments as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the church. in the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the bride of christ who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. he possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. the orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the virgin and the coronation of the virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. this was italian work of the fifteenth century. another cope was of green velvet embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. the morse bore a seraphs head in gold-thread raised work. the orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs among whom was st. sebastian. he had chasubles also of amber-coloured silk and blue silk and gold brocade and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold figured with representations of the passion and crucifixion of christ and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs-de-lis altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen and many corporals chalice-veils and sudaria. in the mystic offices to which such things were put there was something that quickened his imagination. for these treasures and everything that he collected in his lovely house were to be to him means of forgetfulness modes by which he could escape for a season from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne. upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. for weeks he would not go there would forget the hideous painted thing and get back his light heart his wonderful joyousness his passionate absorption in mere existence. then suddenly some night he would creep out of the house go down to dreadful places near blue gate fields and stay there day after day until he was driven away. on his return he would sit in front of the picture sometimes loathing it and himself but fil you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking. i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. do you understand this feeling this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. there—for with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. what may not be expected in a country of eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river. but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine. these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole. you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas library. my education was neglected yet i was passionately fond of reading. these volumes were my study day and night and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt as a child on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life. these visions faded when i perused for the first time those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated. you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment. but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent. six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking. i can even now remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise. i commenced by inuring my body to hardship. i accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea i voluntarily endured cold famine thirst and want of sleep i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. twice i actually hired myself as an under-mate in a greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration. i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness so valuable did he consider my services. and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpo my life might have been passed in ease and luxury but i preferred glor every enticement that wealth placed in my path. oh that some encouragi voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm but my hopes fluctuate and my spirits are often depressed. i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the emergencies of whi will demand all my fortitude i am required not only to raise the spiri of others but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs are failing. this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia. they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges the motion is pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach. the cold is not excessive if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which i have already adopted for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. i have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between st. petersburgh and archangel. i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks and m intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying t insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think neces among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. i do not intend to sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister can i answer this question if i succeed many many months perhaps ye will pass before you and i may meet. if i fail you will see me again s or never. farewell my dear excellent margaret. heaven shower down blessings on and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all yo love and kindness. your affectionate brother r. walton letter 2 to saville england. archangel 28th march 17—. how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage. but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and th absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have friend margaret when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success the will be none to participate my joy if i am assailed by disappointment one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. i shall commit my though to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the communication o feeling. i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me wh eyes would reply to mine. you may deem me romantic my dear sister but bitterly feel the want of a friend. i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind w tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans. how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execu and too impatient of difficulties. but it is a still greater evil to me that i am self-educated for the first fourteen years of my life i ran on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages. at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my na country. now i am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than m schoolboys of fifteen. it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want (as the pain call it) keeping and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. well these are useless complaints i shall certainly find no friend on wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen. yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in thes rugged bosoms. my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful coura and enterprise he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my ph more characteristically of advancement in his profession. he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to as in my enterprise. the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. this circumstance added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage me very desirous to engage him. a youth passed in solitude my best yea spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste t the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it t necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindline of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. i hea of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him t happiness of her life. this briefly is his story. some years ago he l a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a consider sum in prize-money the father of the girl consented to the match. he s his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poo and that her father would never consent to the union. my generous frien reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit. he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover. but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend w when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. what a noble fellow you will exclaim. he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his condu the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command. yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know that i am wavering in my resolutions. those are as fixed as fate and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. the winter has been dreadfully severe but the spring promises well and it is considered as a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected. i shall do nothing rashly you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care. i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with which i am preparing to depart. i am going to unexplored regions to the land of mist and snow but i shall kill no albatross therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ancient mariner. you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret. i have often attributed my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand. i am practically industrious—painstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwined in all my projects which hurries me out of the common pathways of men even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore. but to return to dearer considerations. shall i meet you again after having traversed immense seas and returned by the most southern cape o africa or america i dare not expect such success yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. continue for the present to write t me by every opportunity i may receive your letters on some occasions w i need them most to support my spirits. i love you very tenderly. remember me with affection should you never hear from me again. your affectionate brother robert walton letter 3 to saville england. july 7th 17—. my dear sister i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe—and well advanced on my voyage. this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel more fortunate than i who may not see my native land perhaps for many years. i am however in good spirits my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing appear to dismay them. we have already reached a very high latitude but it is the height of summer and although not so warm as in england the southern gales which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected. no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage adieu my dear margaret. be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger. i will be cool persevering and prudent. but success shall crown my endeavours. wherefore not thus far i have gone tracing a secure way over the pathless seas the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. but i must finish. heaven bless my beloved sister r.w. letter 4 to saville england. august 5th 17—. so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession. last monday (july 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice which closed in the ship on all sides scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. our situation was somewhat dangerous especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. we accordingly lay to hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather. about two oclock the mist cleared away and we beheld stretched out in every direction vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end. some of my comrades groaned and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. we perceived a low carriage fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass on towards the north at the distance of half a mile a being which had the shape of a man but apparently of gigantic stature sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. this appearance excited our unqualified wonder. we were as we believed many hundred miles from any land but this apparition seemed to denote it was not in reality so distant as we had supposed. shut in however ice it was impossible to follow his track which we had observed with greatest attention. about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea and befo night the ice broke and freed our ship. we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses whic float about after the breaking up of the ice. i profited of this time t rest for a few hours. in the morning however as soon as it was light i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel apparently talking to someone in the sea. it was in fact a sledge like that we had seen before which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. only one dog remained alive but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. he was not as the other traveller seemed to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european. when i appeared on deck the master said here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea. on perceiving me the stranger addressed me in english although with a foreign accent. before i come on board your vessel said he will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. i replied however that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. good god margaret if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety your surprise would have been boundless. his limbs were nearly frozen and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. i never saw a man in so wretched a condition. we attempted to carry him into the cabin but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully. two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. when he had in some measure recovered i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. i never saw a more interesting creature his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled. but he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him. when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle. his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom and he replied to seek one who fled from me. and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion yes. then i fancy we have seen him for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge with a man in it across the ice. this aroused the strangers attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon as he called him had pursued. soon after when he was alone with me he said i have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people but you are too considerate to make inquiries. certainly it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine. and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation you have benevolently restored me to life. soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time but of this i could not judge. from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch the sledge which had before appeared but i have persuaded him to remai the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosph i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him although they have had very little communication with him. for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. he must have been a noble creature in his better days being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable. i said in one of my letters my dear margaret that i should find no fr on the wide ocean yet i have found a man who before his spirit had be broken by misery i should have been happy to have possessed as the bro of my heart. i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals should i have any fresh incidents to record. august 13th 17—. my affection for my guest increases every day. he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief he is so gentle yet so wise his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the dec apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. he has frequently conversed with me on mine which i have communicated to him without disguise. he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had tak to secure it. i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my sou and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance o enterprise. one mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought for the dominion i sho acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. as i spoke a dark gloom spread over my listeners countenance. at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion he placed his hands be his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers a groan burst from his heaving breast. i paused at length he spoke in broken accents unhappy man do you share my madness have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught hear let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure. having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion and quelling the dark tyranny o despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. he a me the history of my earlier years. the tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection. i spoke of my desire of finding friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind th had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing. i agree with you replied the stranger we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer t ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. i once had a friend the mos noble of human creatures and am entitled therefore to judge respecti friendship. you have hope and the world before you and have no cause despair. but i—i have lost everything and cannot begin life anew. as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief that touched me to the heart. but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin. even broken in spirit as he is no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. the starry sky the sea and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. such a man has a double existence he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments yet when he has retired into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly ventures. will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer you would not if you saw him. you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world and you are therefore somewhat fastidious but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew. i believe it to be an intuitive discernment a quick but never-failing power of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music. august 19th 17—. yesterday the stranger said to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination. you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been. i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure. prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed. you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. i expressed these feelings in my answer. i thank you he replied for your sympathy but it is useless my fate is nearly fulfilled. i wait but for one event and the shall repose in peace. i understand your feeling continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it determined. he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when should be at leisure. this promise drew from me the warmest thanks. i h resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related dur the day. if i should be engaged i will at least make notes. this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure but to me know him and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his full-toned voice swells in my ears his lustrous eyes dwell o with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm wh embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus chapter 1 i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them. one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty. this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was te months before my father discovered his abode. overjoyed at this discove he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss. but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him. beau had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and i the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchants house. the interval was consequently spent in inaction his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion. his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. she procured plain work she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life. several months passed in this manner. her father grew worse her time was more entirely occupied in attending him her means of subsistence decreased and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar. this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beauforts coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber. he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. two years after this event caroline became his wife. there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. there was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through. during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame. from italy they visited germany and france. i their eldest child was at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. i remain for several years their only child. much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a ver mine of love to bestow them upon me. my mothers tender caresses and my fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. i was their plaything and their idol and somethin better—their child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was i their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfill their duties towards me. with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spi of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charit and of self-control i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed b one train of enjoyment to me. for a long time i was their only care. my mother had much desired to ha daughter but i continued their single offspring. when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy the passed a week on the shores of the lake of como. their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passion—remembering what she had suffered and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a va attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the numb of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode. she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal five hungry babes. among these there was one which attracted my mother above all the rest. she appeared of a different stock. the four others dark-eyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair. he hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. her brow wa clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could beh her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heaven-sen and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history. she w not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman. her mother was german and had died on giving her birth. the infant had been placed wit these good people to nurse they were better off then. they had not bee long married and their eldest child was but just born. the father of t charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique gl of italy—one among the schiavi ognor frementi who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. he became the victim of i weakness. whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of aust was not known. his property was confiscated his child became an orphan a beggar. she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their ru abode fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles. when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hal our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. the apparition was soon explained. with permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. they were fond of the sweet orphan. her presence had see a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in povert and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection. they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth laven became the inmate of my parents house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures. everyone loved elizabeth. the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight. on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully i have a pretty present for my victor—tomorrow he shall have it. and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine—mine to protect love and cherish. all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own. we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister since till death she was to be mine only. chapter 2 we were brought up together there was not quite a year difference in our ages. i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes. the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine. curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember. on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. we possessed a house in geneva and a campagne on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. i was indifferent therefore to my school-fellows in general but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva. he was a boy of singular talent and fancy. he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake. he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love. my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately. i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world. meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things. the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. her sympathy was ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us. she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. and clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition. i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. besi in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events whi led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys. natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. when i was thirteen years of age we all on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa. i opened it with apathy the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonder facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicate discovery to my father. my father looked carelessly at the title page o book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it is sad trash. if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a mo system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powe than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical whi those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. it is even possible that the train of my ideas would ne have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. but the cursory gl my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity. when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of th author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus. i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight they appeared t treasures known to few besides myself. i have described myself as alway having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of mod philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfie sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picki up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquain appeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit. the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. the most learned philosopher knew little more. he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. he might dissect anatomise and give names but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined. but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and kn more. i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple. it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteent century but while i followed the routine of education in the schools o geneva i was to a great degree self-taught with regard to my favouri studies. my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with childs blindness added to a students thirst for knowledge. under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. wealth wa inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any a violent death nor were these my only visions. the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of w i most eagerly sought and if my incantations were always unsuccessful attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than t want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas. when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at on with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. i remaine while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and deligh as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue fro old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house an soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothi remained but a blasted stump. when we visited it the next morning we f the tree shattered in a singular manner. it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me. all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration. thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard. it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectual. destiny was too potent and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction. chapter 3 when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt. i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen as it were of my future misery. elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her illness was severe and she in the greatest danger. during her illness many arguments had been urge persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety. she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over the malign of the distemper—elizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. on the third day my mother sickened her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not dese her. she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself. my children she said my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. this expectation will now be the consolation of your father. elizabeth my love you must supply my plac my younger children. alas i regret that i am taken from you and happ and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these a not thoughts befitting me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world. she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death. i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more to be heard. these are the reflections of the first days but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences. yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished. my mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. my departure for ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon. i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to death of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me. i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me and above all i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled. she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins. never was she so enchanting as at this time when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. the day of my departure at length arrived. clerval spent the last evening with us. he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain. his father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. he said little but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. we sat late. we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word farewell it was said and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose each fancying that the other was deceived but when at mornings dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away they were all there—my father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend. i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged the most melancholy reflections. i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutua pleasure—i was now alone. in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector. my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. i loved my brothers elizabeth and clerval these were old familiar faces but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. such were my reflections i commenced my journey but as i proceeded my spirits and hopes rose. ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. i had often when at hom thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and ha longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. now my desires were complied with and it would indeed have been foll repent. i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing. at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased. the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visi some of the principal professors. chance—or rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which asserted omnipotent sway ove from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my fathers door—led me first to m. krempe professor of natural philosophy. he was an uncouth man but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different bran of science appertaining to natural philosophy. i replied carelessly an partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the princip authors i had studied. the professor stared. have you he said really spent your time in studying such nonsense i replied in the affirmative. every minute continued m. krempe with warmth every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. good god in what desert land have you lived where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient i little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus. my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew. so saying he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations and that m. waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted. i returned home not disappointed for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. m. krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance the teacher therefore did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain perhaps i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years. as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. besides i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power such views although futile were grand but now the scene was changed. the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. but as the ensuing week commenced i thought of the information which m. krempe had given me concerning the lectures. and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit i recollected what he had said of m. waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town. partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i went into the lecturi room which m. waldman entered shortly after. this professor was very unlike his colleague. he appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence a few grey hairs covered temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black. his perso was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever he he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry an the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. he then t a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many o its elementary terms. after having made a few preparatory experiments concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which i shall never forget the ancient teachers of this science said he promised impossibilities and performed nothing. the modern masters promise very little they know that metals cannot be transmuted and tha the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands see only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope crucible have indeed performed miracles. they penetrate into the reces of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. they ascend into heavens they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature the air we breathe. they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows. such were the professors words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me. as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being chord after chord was sounded and soon my mind was filled with one thought one conception one purpose. so much has been done exclaimed the soul of frankenstein—more far more will i achieve treading in the steps already marked i will pioneer a new way explore unknown powers and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation. i closed not my eyes that night. my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil i felt that order would thence arise but i had no power to produce it. by degrees after the mornings dawn sleep came. i awoke and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream. there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent. on the same day i paid m. waldman a visit. his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor. he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m. krempe had exhibited. he said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. they had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. i listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists i expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure. i am happy said m. waldman to have gained a disciple and if your application equals your ability i have no doubt your success. chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which t greatest improvements have been and may be made it is on that account i have made it my peculiar study but at the same time i have not neglected the other branches of science. a man would make but a very so chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. if wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch of natura philosophy including mathematics. he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough the science not to derange their mechanism. he also gave me the list of books which i had requested and i took my leave. thus ended a day memorable to me it decided my future destiny. chapter 4 from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the term became nearly my sole occupation. i read with ardour those works so full of genius and discrimination which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i found even in m. krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information combined it is true with a repulsive physiognomy and manners but not on that account the less valuable. in m. waldman i found a true friend. his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory. as i applied so closely it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students and my proficiency that of the masters. professor krempe often asked me with a sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m. waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. two years passed in this manner during which i paid no visit to geneva but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make. none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you and there is nothing more to know but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study and i who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements i thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay. one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life. whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death. i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm. now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret. remember i am not recording the vision of a madman. the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true. some miracle might have produced it yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life nay more i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter. the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated and i beheld only the result. what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. not that like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light. i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express my friend that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted that cannot be listen patiently until the end of my story and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject. i will not lead you on unguarded and ardent as i then was to your destruction and infallible misery. learn from me if not by my precepts at least by my example how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it. although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles and veins still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler organization but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed. i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses my operations might be incessantly baffled and at last my work be imperfect yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being. as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved contrary to my first intention to make the being of a gigantic stature that is to say about eight feet in height and proportionably large. after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began. no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success. life and death appeared to me ideal bounds which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs. pursuing these reflections i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time (although i now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption. these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement. sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise. one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hiding-places. who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits. i collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame. in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. the dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion. the summer months passed while i was thus engaged heart and soul in one pursuit. it was a most beautiful season never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom i had not seen for so long a time. i knew my silence disquieted them and i well remembered the words of my father i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection and we shall hear regularly from you. you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected. i knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. i wished as it were to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object which swallowed up every habit of my nature should be completed. i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame. a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind. if this rule were always observed if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections greece had not been enslaved cæsar would have spared his country america would have been discovered more gradually and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed. but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale and your looks remind me to proceed. my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. winter spring and summer passed away during my labours but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was i engrossed in my occupation. the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew ne to a close and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded. but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. every night i was oppressed by a slow fever and i became nervous to a painful degree the fall of a leaf startled me and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime. sometimes i grew alarmed the wreck i perceived that i had become the energy of my purpose alone sustained me my labours would soon end and i believed that exercise a amusement would then drive away incipient disease and i promised mysel both of these when my creation should be complete. chapter 5 it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils. with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony i collected the instruments of life around me that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. it was already one in the morning the rain pattered dismally against the panes and my candle was nearly burnt out when by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open it breathed hard and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful. beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. for this i had deprived myself of rest and health. i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber unable to compose my mind to sleep. at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. but it was in vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams. i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt. delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. i started from my sleep with horror a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom i had created. he held up the curtain of the bed and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me. his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs. i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life. oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. i had gazed on him while unfinished he was ugly then but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived. i passed the night wretchedly. sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. mingled with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me and the change was so rapid the overthrow so complete morning dismal and wet at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt its white steeple and clock which indicated the sixth hour. the porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issued into the streets pacing them with quick steps as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view. i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. i continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing. my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear and i hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread. [coleridges ancient mariner.] continuing thus i came at length opposite to the inn at which the vari diligences and carriages usually stopped. here i paused i knew not why but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was comi towards me from the other end of the street. as it drew nearer i observ that it was the swiss diligence it stopped just where i was standing on the door being opened i perceived henry clerval who on seeing me instantly sprung out. my dear frankenstein exclaimed he how glad i am to see you how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval his presence brought to my thoughts my father elizabeth and all those scenes of home so de to my recollection. i grasped his hand and in a moment forgot my horro and misfortune i felt suddenly and for the first time during many mon calm and serene joy. i welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordi manner and we walked towards my college. clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt. you may easily believe said he how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping and indeed i believe i left him incredulous to the last for his cons answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield ‘i have ten thousand florins a year without greek i eat heartily without greek. but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge. it gives me the greatest delight to see you but tell me how you left my father brothers and elizabeth. very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. by the by i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself. but my dear frankenstein continued he stopping short and gazing full in my face i did not before remark how very ill you appear so thin and pale you look as if you had been watching for several nights. you have guessed right i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest as you see but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free. i trembled excessively i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night. i walked with a quick pace and we soon arrived at my college. i then reflected and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there alive and walking about. i dreaded to behold this monster but i feared still more that henry should see him. entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs i darted up towards my own room. my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself. i then paused and a cold shivering came over me. i threw the door forcibly open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side but nothing appeared. i stepped fearfully in the apartment was empty and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval. we ascended into my room and the servant presently brought breakfast but i was unable to contain myself. it was not joy only that possessed me i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly. i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place i jumped over the chairs clapped my hands and laughed aloud. clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival but when he observed me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him. my dear victor cried he what for gods sake is the matter do not laugh in that manner. how ill you are what is th cause of all this do not ask me cried i putting my hands before my eyes for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room he can tell. oh save me save me i imagined that the monster seized me i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit. poor clerval what must have been his feelings a meeting which he anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness. but i was not the witness of his grief for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long long time. this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. during all that time henry was my only nurse. i afterwards learned that knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself and firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them. but i was in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes and i raved incessantly concerning him. doubtless my words surprised henry he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event. by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend i recovered. i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. it was a divine spring and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom my gloom disappeared and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion. dearest clerval exclaimed i how kind how very good you are to me. this whole winter instead of being spent in study as y promised yourself has been consumed in my sick room. how shall i ever repay you i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which have been the occasion but you will forgive me. you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well as fast as you can and since you appear in such good spirits i may speak to you on one subject may i not i trembled. one subject what could it be could he allude to an object whom i dared not even think compose yourself said clerval who observed my change of colour i will not mention it if it agitates you but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in yo own handwriting. they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy your long silence. is that all my dear henry how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love if this is your present temper my friend you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you it is from your cousin i believe. chapter 6 clerval then put the following letter into my hands. it was from my own elizabeth my dearest cousin you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. you are forbidden to write—to hold a pen yet one word from you dear victor is necessary to calm our apprehensions. for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt. i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. yet that is over now clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting. get well—and return to us. you will find a happy cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. your fathers health is vigorous and he asks but to see you but to be assured that you are well and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service but we cannot part with him at least until his elder brother returns to us. my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never had your powers of application. he looks upon study as an odious fetter his time is spent in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected. little alteration except the growth of our dear children has taken place since you left us. the blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy kind faces around me. since you left us but one change has taken place in our little household. do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few words. madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third. this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m. moritz treated her very ill. my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral. a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england. justine thus received in our family learned the duties of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. justine you may remember was a great favourite of yours and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. this benefit was fully repaid justine was the most grateful little creature in the world i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her. when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. poor justine was very ill but other trials were reserved for her. one by one her brothers and sister died and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless. the conscience of the woman was troubled she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. she was a roman catholic and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother. poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity. nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety. the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever. she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter. justine has just returned to us and i assure you i love her tenderly. she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt. i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william. i wish you could see him he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair. when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health. he has already had one or two little wives but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age. now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva. the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq. her ugly sister manon married m. duvillard the rich banker last autumn. your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva. but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier. she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody. i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude. write dearest victor—one line—one word will be a blessing to us. ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness his affection and his many letters we are sincerely grateful. adieu my cousin take care of yourself and i entreat you write elizabeth lavenza. geneva march 18th 17—. dear dear elizabeth i exclaimed when i had read her letter i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel. i wrote and this exertion greatly fatigued me but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly. in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber. one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university. in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view. he had also changed my apartment for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors. m. waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences. he soon perceived that i disliked the subject but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out. what could i do he meant to please and he tormented me. i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt. clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance and the conversation took a more general turn. i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak. i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. m. krempe was not equally docile and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomiums gave me e more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman. d—n the fellow cried he why m. clerval i assure you he has outstript us all. ay stare if you please but it is nevertheless true. youngster who but a few years ago believed in cornelius agrippa as fi as in the gospel has now set himself at the head of the university an he is not soon pulled down we shall all be out of countenance.—ay ay continued he observing my face expressive of suffering m. frankenstein is modest an excellent quality in a young man. young men should be diffident of themselves you know m. clerval i wa myself when young but that wears out in a very short time. m. krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me. clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies. idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours. their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart. how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome summer passed away in these occupations and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn but being delayed by several accidents winter and snow arrived the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. i felt this delay very bitterly for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. the winter however was spent cheerfully and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness. the month of may had already commenced and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited. i acceded with pleasure to this proposition i was fond of exercise and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country. we passed a fortnight in these perambulations my health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed the natural incidents of our progress and the conversation of my friend. study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures and rendered me unsocial but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children. excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses i became the same happy creature who a few years ago loved and beloved by all had no sorrow or care. when happy inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. the present season was indeed divine the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud. i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off with an invincible burden. henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings exerted himself to amuse me while he expressed the sensations that fil his soul. the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing his conversation was full of imagination and very often imitation of the persian and arabic writers he invented tales of wonde fancy and passion. at other times he repeated my favourite poems or dr me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity. we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon the peasants were dancing and every one we met appeared gay and happy. my own spirits we high and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity. chapter 7 on my return i found the following letter from my father— my dear victor you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you. but that would be a cruel kindness and i dare not do it. what would be your surprise my son when you expected a happy and glad welcome to behold on the contrary tears and wretchedness and how victor can i relate our misfortune absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son i wish to prepare you for the woeful news but i know it is impossible even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings. william is dead—that sweet child whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart who was so gentle yet so gay victor he is murdered i will not attempt to console you but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. last thursday (may 7th) i my niece and your two brothers went to walk in plainpalais. the evening was warm and serene and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. it was already dusk before we thought of returning and then we discovered that william and ernest who had gone on before were not to be found. we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. presently ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother he said that he had been playing with him that william had run away to hide himself and that he vainly sought for him and afterwards waited for a long time but that he did not return. this account rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him until night fell when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. he was not there. we returned again with torches for i could not rest when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless the print of the murders finger was on his neck. he was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth. she was very earnest to see the corpse. at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed ‘o god i have murdered my darling child she fainted and was restored with extreme difficulty. when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh. she told me that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. this picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. we have no trace of him at present although our exertions to discover him are unremitted but they will not restore my beloved william come dearest victor you alone can console elizabeth. she weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death her words pierce my heart. we are all unhappy but will not that be an additional motive for you my son to return and be our comforter your dear mother alas victor i now say thank god she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling come victor not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wounds of our minds. enter the house of mourning my friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you and not with hatred for your enemies. your affectionate and afflicted father alphonse frankenstein. geneva may 12th 17—. clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving new from my friends. i threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands. my dear frankenstein exclaimed henry when he perceived me weep with bitterness are you always to be unhappy my dear friend what has happened i motioned him to take up the letter while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval as he read the account of my misfortune. i can offer you no consolation my friend said he your disaster is irreparable. what do you intend to do to go instantly to geneva come with me henry to order the horses. during our walk clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. poor william said he dear lovely child he now sleeps with his angel mother who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so miserably to feel the murderers grasp how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence poor little fellow one only consolation have we his friends mourn and weep but he is at rest. the pang is over his sufferings are at an end for ever. a sod covers his gentle form and he knows no pain. he can no longer be a subject for pity we must reserve that for his miserable survivors. clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude. but now as soon as the horses arrived i hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend. my journey was very melancholy. at first i wished to hurry on for i lo to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends but when drew near my native town i slackened my progress. i could hardly susta the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. i passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which i had not seen for nearly six ye how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which although they we done more tranquilly might not be the less decisive. fear overcame me dared no advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremb although i was unable to define them. i remained two days at lausanne in this painful state of mind. i contemplated the lake the waters were placid all around was calm and snowy mountains the palaces of nature were not changed. by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me and i continued my jou towards geneva. the road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as i approached my native town. i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc. i wept like a child. dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer your summits are clear the sky and lake are blue and placid. is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances but they were days of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure. my country my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake yet as i drew nearer home grief and fear again overcame me. night als closed around and when i could hardly see the dark mountains i felt s more gloomily. the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of hu beings. alas i prophesied truly and failed only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure. it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva the ga of the town were already shut and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the city. the was serene and as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered. as i could not pass through th town i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalai during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of m blanc in the most beautiful figures. the storm appeared to approach rapidly and on landing i ascended a low hill that i might observe i progress. it advanced the heavens were clouded and i soon felt the ra coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly increased. i quitted my seat and walked on although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. it was echoed from salêve the juras and the alps of savoy vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake making it appear like a vast sheet of fire then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. the storm as is often the case in switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of copêt. another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the môle a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. while i watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wandered on w a hasty step. this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits i clasped hands and exclaimed aloud william dear angel this is thy funeral this thy dirge as i said these words i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me i stoo fixed gazing intently i could not be mistaken. a flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than bel to humanity instantly informed me that it was the wretch the filthy dæmon to whom i had given life. what did he there could he be (i shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother no sooner did idea cross my imagination than i became convinced of its truth my tee chattered and i was forced to lean against a tree for support. the fig passed me quickly and i lost it in the gloom. nothing in human shape c have destroyed the fair child. he was the murderer i could not doubt it. the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of th fact. i thought of pursuing the devil but it would have been in vain another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearl perpendicular ascent of mont salêve a hill that bounds plainpalais on south. he soon reached the summit and disappeared. i remained motionless. the thunder ceased but the rain still continued and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget the whole train of my progress toward the creation the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside its departure. two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life and was this his first crime alas i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery had he not murdered my brother no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night which i spent cold and wet in the open air. but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror such as the deed which he had now done nearly in the light of my own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me. day dawned and i directed my steps towards the town. the gates were open and i hastened to my fathers house. my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made. but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell. a being whom i myself had formed and endued with life had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. besides the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. and then of what use would be pursuit who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont salêve these reflections determined me and i resolved to remain silent. it was about five in the morning when i entered my fathers house. i told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising. six years had elapsed passed in a dream but for one indelible trace a stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt. beloved and venerable parent he still remain to me. i gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantel-piece. it was an historical subject painted at my fathers desire and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair kneel by the coffin of her dead father. her garb was rustic and her cheek pa but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. below this picture was a miniature of william and m tears flowed when i looked upon it. while i was thus engaged ernest entered he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me welcome my dearest victor said he. ah i wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous delighted. you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—poor william he was our darling and our pride tears unrestrained fell from my brothers eyes a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. before i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster. i tried to calm ernest i enquired more minutely concerning my father and here i named my cousin. she most of all said ernest requires consolation she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother and that made her very wretched. but since the murderer has been discovered— the murderer discovered good god how can that be who could attempt to pursue him it is impossible one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. i saw him too he was free last night i do not know what you mean replied my brother in accents of wonder but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. no one would believe it at first and even now elizabeth will not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence. indeed who would credit that justine moritz who was so amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appalling a crime justine moritz poor poor girl is she the accused but it is wrongfully every one knows that no one believes it surely ernest no one did at first but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt. but she will be tried today and you will then hear all. he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days. during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. the servant instantly showed it to one of the others who without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate and upon their deposition justine was apprehended. on being charged with the fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner. this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and i replied earnestly you are all mistaken i know the murderer. justine poor good justine is innocent. at that instant my father entered. i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster had not ernest exclaimed good god papa victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william. we do also unfortunately replied my father for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly. my dear father you are mistaken justine is innocent. if she is god forbid that she should suffer as guilty. she is to be tried today and i hope i sincerely hope that she will be acquitted. this speech calmed me. i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder. i had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. my tale was not one to announce publicly its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. did any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world we were soon joined by elizabeth. time had altered her since i last beheld her it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. there was the same candour the same vivacity but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. she welcomed me with the greatest affection. your arrival my dear cousin said she fills me with hope. you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine. alas who is safe if she be convicted of crime i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own. our misfortune is doubly hard to us we have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love is to be torn away by even a worse fate. if she is condemned i never shall know joy more. but she will not i am sure she will not and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william. she is innocent my elizabeth said i and that shall be proved fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assuran of her acquittal. how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt and that made me wretched for i knew that it was impossible and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing. she wept. dearest niece said my father dry your tears. if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our laws and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality. chapter 8 we passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock when the trial was to commence. my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses i accompanied them to the court. during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture. it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me. the appearance of justine was calm. she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful. yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. she was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness. the trial began and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called. several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had. she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. she returned to the house about eight oclock and when one inquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. when shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket and when elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court. justine was called on for her defence. as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered. surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed. sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice. god knows she said how entirely i am innocent. but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me i rest my innoce on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline m judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious. she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chêne a village situated at about a league from geneva. on her return at about nine oclock she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of geneva were shut and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known. most of the night she spent here watching towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes some steps disturbed her and she awoke. it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother. if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge. that she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain. concerning the picture she could give no account. i know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. but here also i am checked. i believe that i have enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy wantonly. did the murderer place it there i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing or if i had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope. i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence. several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court. i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have live with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion bu when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of h pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character. i am well acquainted with the accused. i have li in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nea two years. during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable a benevolent of human creatures. she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that exci the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncles house where she was beloved by all the family. she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like most affectionate mother. for my own part i do not hesitate to say tha notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and re on her perfect innocence. she had no temptation for such an action as the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her. a murmur of approbation followed elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude. she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer. my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. i believed in her innocence i knew it. could the dæmon who had (i did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy i could not sustain the horror of my situation and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out of the court in agony. the tortures of the accused did not equal mine she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold. i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. in the morning i went to the court my lips and throat were parched. i dared not ask the fatal question but i was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. the ballots had been thrown they were all black and justine was condemned. i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt. i had before experienced sensations of horror and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that i then endured. the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt. that evidence he observed was hardly required in so glaring a case but i am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive. this was strange and unexpected intelligence what could it mean had my eyes deceived me and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions i hastened to return home and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. my cousin replied i it is decided as you may have expected all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. but she has confessed. this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness up justines innocence. alas said she. how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i loved and esteeme my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betra her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she ha committed a murder. soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see cousin. my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her judgment and feelings to decide. yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilty and you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone. the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse. we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end her hands were manacled and her head rested her knees. she rose on seeing us enter and when we were left alone wit her she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth weeping bitterly. my cousin wept also. oh justine said she. why did you rob me of my last consolation i relied on your innocence and although i was then very wretched i was not so miserable as i am now. and do you also believe that i am so very very wicked do you also join with my enemies to crush me to condemn me as a murderer her voice was suffocated with sobs. rise my poor girl said elizabeth why do you kneel if you are innocent i am not one of your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for moment but your own confession. i did confess but i confessed a lie. i confessed that i might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. the god of heaven forgive me ever since i was condemned my confessor has besieged me he threatened and menaced until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was. he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate. dear lady i had none to support me all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. what could i do in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie and now only am i truly miserable. she paused weeping and then continued i thought with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy and that consoles me going as i am to suffer ignominy and death. oh justine forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. why did you confess but do not mourn dear girl. do not fear. i will proclaim i will prove your innocence. i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune. justine shook her head mournfully. i do not fear to die she said that pang is past. god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. i leave a sad and bitter world and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me. learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. despair who dared talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony. i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. justine started. when she saw who it was she approached me and said dear sir you are very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe that i am guilty i could not answer. no justine said elizabeth he is more convinced of your innocence than i was for even when he heard that you had confessed he did not credit it. i truly thank him. in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you dear lady and your cousin. thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. she indeed gained the resignation she desired. but i the true murderer felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom which allowed of no hope or consolation. elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away. i wish cried she that i were to die with you i cannot live in this world of misery. justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears. she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so. and on the morrow justine died. elizabeths heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men my purposed avowal died away on my lips. thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. she perished on the scaffold as a murderess from the tortures of my own heart i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth. this also was my doing and my fathers woe and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands ye weep unhappy ones but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein your son your kinsman your early much-loved friend he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep to shed countless tears happy beyond his hopes if thus inexorable fate be satisfied and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments thus spoke my prophetic soul as torn by remorse horror and despair i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts. chapter 9 nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. justine died she rested and i was alive. the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove. sleep fled from my eyes i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more (i persuaded myself) was yet behind. yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue. i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings. now all was blasted instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe. this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. i shunned the face of man all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me solitude was my only consolation—deep dark deathlike solitude. my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my dispositi and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of hi serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me do you think victor said he that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i loved your brother—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmentin their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief it is also a du owed to yourself for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoymen or even the discharge of daily usefulness without which no man is fit society. this advice although good was totally inapplicable to my case i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness and terror its alarm with my other sensations. now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view. about this time we retired to our house at belrive. this change was particularly agreeable to me. the shutting of the gates regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me. i was now free. often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water. sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore—often i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever. but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine. i thought also of my father and surviving brother should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness. but that could not be. remorse extinguished every hope. i had been the author of unalterable evils and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i ha created should perpetrate some new wickedness. i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind. my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. when i thought him i gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and i ardently wished extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed. when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bou of moderation. i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of th andes could i when there have precipitated him to their base. i wish to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on head and avenge the deaths of william and justine. our house was the house of mourning. my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events. elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tears then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blaste and destroyed. she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier you wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of ou future prospects. the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her deare smiles. when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood. yet i am certainly unjust. everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. but she was innocent. i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me. alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected. but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch. i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer. elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said my dearest friend you must calm yourself. these events have affected me god knows how deeply but i am not so wretched as you are. there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble. dear victor banish these dark passions. remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you. have we lost the power of rendering you happy ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her. thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual. i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it and to die was but a type of me. sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my intolerable sensations. it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys sought in the magnificence the eternity of such scenes to forget myself and my ephemeral because human sorrows. my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix. i had visited it frequently during my boyhood. six years had passed since then i was a wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes. i performed the first part of my journey on horseback. i afterwards hired a mule as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. the weather was fine it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe. the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve. the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotence—and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific guise. still as i ascended higher the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains the impetuous arve and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all as belonging to another earth the habitations of another race of beings. i passed the bridge of pélissier where the ravine which the river forms opened before me and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. soon after i entered the valley of chamounix. this valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox through which i had just passed. the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. immense glaciers approached the road i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles and its tremendous dôme overlooked the valley. a tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. some turn in the road some new object suddenly perceived and recognised reminded me of days gone by and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. the very winds whispered in soothing accents and maternal nature bade me weep no more. then again the kindly influence ceased to act—i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection. then i spurred on my animal striving so to forget the world my fears and more than all myself—or in a more desperate fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair. at length i arrived at the village of chamounix. exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured. for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath. the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion. chapter 10 i spent the following day roaming through the valley. i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley. the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me the icy wall of the glacier overhung me a few shattered pines were scattered around and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving. they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it. in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. i retired to rest at night my slumbers as it were waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day. they congregated round me the unstained snowy mountain-top the glittering pinnacle the pine woods and ragged bare ravine the eagle soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace. where had they fled when the next morning i awoke all of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep and dark melancholy clouded every thought. the rain was pouring in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. what were rain and storm to me my mule was brought to the door and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert. i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it. it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. i determined to go without a guide for i was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene. the ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. it is a scene terrifically desolate. in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. the path as you ascend higher is intersected by ravines of snow down which stones continually roll from above one of them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as even speaking in a loud voice produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. the pines are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. i looked on the valley beneath vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me. alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute it only renders them more necessary beings. if our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us. we rest a dream has power to poison sleep. we rise one wandring thought pollutes the day. we feel conceive or reason laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our cares away it is the same for be it joy or sorrow the path of its departure still is free. mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow nought may endure but mutability it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent. for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier. the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it. the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty. i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. my heart which was before sorrowful now swelled with something like joy i exclaimed wandering spirits if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life. as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed. he bounded over the crevices in the ice among which i had walked with caution his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man. i was troubled a mist came over my eyes and i felt a faintness seize me but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. i perceived as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred) that it was the wretch whom i had created. i trembled with rage and horror resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. he approached his countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignity while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. but i scarcely observed this rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt. devil i exclaimed do you dare approach me and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable h begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust a oh that i could with the extinction of your miserable existence rest those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered i expected this reception said the dæmon. all men hate the wretched how then must i be hated who am miserable beyond all living things yet you my creator detest and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. you purpose to kill me. how dare you sport thus with life do your duty towards me and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. if you will comply with my conditions i will leave them and you at peace but if you refuse i will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends. abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. wretched devil you reproach me with your creation come on then that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed. my rage was without bounds i sprang on him impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another. he easily eluded me and said be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. have i not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it. remember thou hast made me more powerful than thyself my height is superior to thine my joints more supple. but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. i am thy creature and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part the which thou owest me. oh frankenstein be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone to whom thy justice and even thy clemency and affection is most due. remember that i am thy creature i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. everywhere i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded. i was benevolent and good misery made me a fiend. make me happy and i shall again be virtuous. begone i will not hear you. there can be no community between you and me we are enemies. begone or let us try our strength in a fight in which one must fall. how can i move thee will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature who implores thy goodness and compassion believe me frankenstein i was benevolent my soul glowed with love and humanity but am i not alone miserably alone you my creator abhor me what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures who owe me nothing they spurn and hate me. the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. i have wandered here many days the caves of ice which i only do not fear are a dwelling to me and the only one which man does not grudge. these bleak skies i hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction. shall i not then hate them who abhor me i will keep no terms with my enemies. i am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness. yet it is in your power to recompense me and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me. listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve. but hear me. the guilty are allowed by human laws bloody as they are to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. listen to me frankenstein. you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature. oh praise the eternal justice of man yet i ask you not to spare me listen to me and then if you can and if you will destroy the work of your hands. why do you call to my remembrance i rejoined circumstances of which i shudder to reflect that i have been the miserable origin and author cursed be the day abhorred devil in which you first saw light cursed (although i curse myself) be the hands that formed you you have made me wretched beyond expression. you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not. begone relieve me from the sight of your detested form. thus i relieve thee my creator he said and placed his hated hands before my eyes which i flung from me with violence thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor. still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. by the virtues that i once possessed i demand this from you. hear my tale it is long and strange and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations come to the hut upon the mountain. the sun is yet high in the heavens before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide. on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin. as he said this he led the way across the ice i followed. my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution. i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. for the first time also i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness. these motives urged me to comply with his demand. we crossed the ice therefore and ascended the opposite rock. the air was cold and the rain again began to descend we entered the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits. but i consented to listen and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted he thus began his tale. chapter 11 it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes. darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again. i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations. before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid. the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade. this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst. this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep. it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate. before i had quitted your apartment on a sensation of cold i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. i was a poor helpless miserable wretch i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept. soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. [the moon] i gazed with a kind of wonder. it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries. i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak with which i covered myself and sat down upon the ground. no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused. i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other. i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. i began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again. the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest. my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas. my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another. i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing. one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it. in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn. i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep. it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire. i uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees. i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers. i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved. food however became scarce and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied. in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun. i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground. it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity. finding the door open i entered. an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast. he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me. but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetrate the ground was dry and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like. then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep. it was noon when i awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground i determined to recommence my travels and depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet i found i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village. how miraculous did this appear the huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. the vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite. one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted. the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village. this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it. my place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it. no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain. here then i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man. as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found. it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out all the light i enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me. having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm. being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the rain-dropping branches and dank earth. i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel. the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad. i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk. as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. she followed and they disappeared. presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard. on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood. in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate. through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet. he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions. soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire. she afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. after he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together. the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat. the meal was quickly dispatched. the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth. nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. one was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. the old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields. night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours. in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters. the family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as i conjectured to rest. chapter 12 i lay on my straw but i could not sleep. i thought of the occurrences of the day. what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not. i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions. the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal. this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within. the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles. they were not entirely happy. the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it. if such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched. yet why were these gentle beings unhappy they possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one anothers company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. what did their tears imply did they really express pain i was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic. a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves. this trait of kindness moved me sensibly. i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood. i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours. i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days. i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a pile of wood on the outside. she uttered some words in a loud voice an youth joined her who also expressed surprise. i observed with pleasur that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing th cottage and cultivating the garden. by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment. i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. i perceived that the word they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in t minds and countenances of the hearers. this was indeed a godlike scienc and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it. but i was baffled every attempt i made for this purpose. their pronunciation was quick a the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference. by great application however and after ha remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hove discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objec discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood. i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. the youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had o one which was father. the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son. i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to ea these sounds and was able to pronounce them. i distinguished several ot words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as g dearest unhappy. i spent the winter in this manner. the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathised in their joys. i saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. the old man i could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy. he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. it was not thus with felix. he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man. i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. in the midst of poverty and want felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him. at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha. this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour for i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted. i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace beauty and delicate complexions but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity. as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth. from this time felix was more employed and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. their food as i afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome and they procured a sufficiency of it. several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced. the old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. this frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been. my mode of life in my hovel was uniform. during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was star-light i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. when i returned as often as it was necessary i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix. i afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful but i did not then understand the signification of these terms. my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad. i thought (foolish wretch) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flitted before me. i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me. i imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words i should first win their favour and afterwards their love. these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease. it was as the ass and the lap-dog yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration. the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. the birds sang in more cheerful notes and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before was bleak damp and unwholesome. my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature the past was blotted from my memory the present was tranquil and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy. chapter 13 i now hasten to the more moving part of my story. i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am. spring advanced rapidly the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty. it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar and the children listened to him—that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow. felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door. it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a country-man as a guide. the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix. her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided her eyes were dark but gentle although animated her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger. she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian. she did not appear to understand him but smiled. he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage. some conversation took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately. i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian. agatha the ever-gentle agatha kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend. presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end. the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others. as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early. when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said ‘good night sweet safie. he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible. the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods. when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it. she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors. in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered. my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken. while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight. the book from which felix instructed safie was volneys ruins of empires. i should not have understood the purport of this book had felix in reading it given very minute explanations. he had chosen thi work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of eastern authors. through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of hi and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the diffe nations of the earth. i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendo genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful v of the early romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings. i of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over th hapless fate of its original inhabitants. these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing. every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me. i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood. the words induced me to turn towards myself. i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property. i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man. i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs. when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me. was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge. oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was death—a state which i feared yet did not understand. i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows. the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me. the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me. miserable unhappy wretch other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds. but where were my friends and relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing. from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion. i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans. i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so i loved in an innocent half-painful self-deceit to call them). chapter 14 some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends. it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was. the name of the old man was de lacey. he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford. the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin. he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government. he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him. he was tried and condemned to death. the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant all paris was indignant and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation. felix had accidentally been present at the trial his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means. after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard. the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness. during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french. she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate. i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha. before i depart i will give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you. safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her. the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad. this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements ill-suited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her. the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris. felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself. he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris. felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions. safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks and safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans. he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited. he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris. the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison. the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. this idea was torture to him. he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding. he did not succeed. they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country. they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them. felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance. such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family. he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul. when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country. the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate. a few days after the turk entered his daughters apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours. he intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn. when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination. taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany. she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill. safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. she fell however into good hands. the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover. chapter 15 such was the history of my beloved cottagers. it impressed me deeply. i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind. as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year. one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i foun the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress some books. i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of whi had acquired at the cottage they consisted of paradise lost a volum of plutarchs lives and the sorrows of werter. the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continuall studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends w employed in their ordinary occupations. i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. in the sorrows of werter besides the interest of its simple and affecti story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. but i thought werter himself a more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but it sank deep. the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it. as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener. i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none. ‘the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation. my person was hideous and my stature gigantic. what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them. the volume of plutarchs lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. this book had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter. i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages. many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience. i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas. but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species. i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone. induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus. the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations. but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions. i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history. it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own. like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone. many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me. another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory. at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence. it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. you doubtless recollect these papers. here they are. everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. i sickened as i read. ‘hateful day when i received life i exclaimed in agony. ‘accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance. satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred. these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail. besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity. several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage. the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants. they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous. increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was. i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade. i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone. i remembered adams supplication to his creator. but where was mine he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him. autumn passed thus. i saw with surprise and grief the leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers. their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. they loved and sympathised with one another and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food or rest i required kindness and sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it. the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life. my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors. one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage. when his children had departed he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before. at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection. my heart beat quick this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears. the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. all was silent in and around the cottage it was an excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground. again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage. i knocked. ‘who is there said the old man. ‘come in. i entered. ‘pardon this intrusion said i ‘i am a traveller in want of a little rest you would greatly oblige me if yo would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire. ‘enter said de lacey ‘and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you. ‘do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food it is warmth and rest only that i need. i sat down and a silence ensued. i knew that every minute was precious to me yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview when the old man addressed me. ‘by your language stranger i suppose you are my countryman are you french ‘no but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only. i am now going to claim the protection of some friends whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hopes. ‘are they germans ‘no they are french. but let us change the subject. i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth. these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me. i am full of fears for if i fail there i am an outcast in the world for ever. ‘do not despair. to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest are full of brotherly love and charity. rely therefore on your hopes and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair. ‘they are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me. i have good dispositions my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster. ‘that is indeed unfortunate but if you are really blameless cannot you undeceive them ‘i am about to undertake that task and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors. i tenderly love these friends i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome. ‘where do these friends reside ‘near this spot. the old man paused and then continued ‘if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature. ‘excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer. you raise me from the dust by this kindness and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures. ‘heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue. i also am unfortunate i and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes. ‘how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting. ‘may i know the names and residence of those friends i paused. this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors. i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried ‘now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek. do not you desert me in the hour of trial ‘great god exclaimed the old man. ‘who are you at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered. who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage. felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. i could have torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope. but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained. i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel. chapter 16 cursed cursed creator why did i live why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession of me my feelings were those of rage and revenge. i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery. when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. all save i were at rest or in enjoyment i like the arch-fiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathised with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin. but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemies no from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery. the sun rose i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day. accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation. the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions. i had certainly acted imprudently. it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach. but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party. these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his fathers feet. i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hiding-place and went in search of food. when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage. all there was at peace. i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear. i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune. the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense. presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors. soon after however felix approached with another man i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances. ‘do you consider said his companion to him ‘that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination. ‘it is utterly useless replied felix ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage. the life of my father is in the great danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related. my wife my sister will never recover from their horror. i entreat you not to re with me any more. take possession of your tenement and let me fly from place. felix trembled violently as he said this. he and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes and then departed. i never saw any of the family of de lacey more. i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world. for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death. when i thought of my friends of the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects. as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations. as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched. a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected. the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues. as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods. and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible. at length the thought of you crossed my mind. i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed. but how was i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide. i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being but i did not despair. from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred. unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form. my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense. it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided. i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless rain and snow poured around me mighty rivers were frozen the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter. oh earth how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not. a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country but i often wandered wide from my path. the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings. i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man. one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me. half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy. soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me. i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring. here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport. she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream. i rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore. she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired. i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood. this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. but the agony of my wound overcame me my pulses paused and i fainted. for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received. the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through at any rate i had no means of extracting it. my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. my daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured. after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey. the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure. but my toils now drew near a close and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva. it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you. i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura. at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy. suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth. urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said ‘child what is the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me. he struggled violently. ‘let me go he cried ‘monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. you are an ogre. let me go or i will tell my papa. ‘boy you will never see your father again you must come with me. ‘hideous monster let me go. my papa is a syndic—he is m. frankenstein—he will punish you. you dare not keep me. ‘frankenstein you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge you shall be my first victim. the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart i grasped his throat to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my feet. i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed ‘i too can create desolation my enemy is not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him. as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast. i took it it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me. for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered that i was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright. can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them. while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hiding-place i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. a woman was sleeping on some straw she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. here i thought is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. and then i bent over her and whispered ‘awake fairest thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes my beloved awake the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror ran through me. should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. the thought was madness it stirred the fiend within me—not i but she shall suffer the murder i have committed because i am for ever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone. the crime had its source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief. i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. she moved again and i fled. for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition. i am alone and miserable man will not associate with me but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects. this being you must create. chapter 17 the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply. but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. he continued you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede. the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me. i do refuse it i replied and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. begone i have answered you you may torture me but i will never consent. you are in the wrong replied the fiend and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you. i am malicious because am miserable. am i not shunned and hated by all mankind you my creato would tear me to pieces and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me you would not call it murder if could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame work of your own hands. shall i respect man when he condemns me let hi live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i wo bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. i will revenge my injuries if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred. have a care i will work at your destruction finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth. a fiendish rage animated him as he said this his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold but presently he calmed himself and proceeded— i intended to reason. this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and hundredfold for that one creatures sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realise what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself the gratification is small but is all that i can receive and it shall content me. it is true we shal monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be m attached to one another. our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel. oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see th excite the sympathy of some existing thing do not deny me my request i was moved. i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument. his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continued if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again i will go to the vast wilds of south america. my food is not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. we shall make our bed of dried leaves the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire. you propose replied i to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness you will meet with their detestation your evil passions will be renewe and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destructio this may not be cease to argue the point for i cannot consent. how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complain i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places. my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quiet away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker. his words had a strange effect upon me. i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. i tried to stifle these sensations i thought that as i could not sympathise with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. you swear i said to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrus you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge how is this i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer. if i have no ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal. i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded. i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed. i thought of the promise of virtues wh he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent bli of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors ha manifested towards him. his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glacie and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipic was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him a my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his reques turning to him therefore i said i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever and every other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile. i swear he cried by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again. depart to you home and commence your labours i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear. saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments. i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice. his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow. the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. night was far advanced when i came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me become as nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness. these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me. morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva. even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family. my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak. i felt as if i were placed under a ban—as if i had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might i enjoy companionship with them. yet even thus i loved them to adoration and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life. chapter 18 day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work. i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably. my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude. i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless. but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart. it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it. reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all. i trembled violently at his exordium and my father continued— i confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and stay of my declining years. you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy you studied together and appeared in dispositions a tastes entirely suited to one another. but so blind is the experience man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. you perhaps regard her as your sister without wish that she might become your wife. nay you may have met with anothe whom you may love and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you app to feel. my dear father reassure yourself. i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection. my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union. the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced. if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us. but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate. tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. we have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. you are younger yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity. i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace. i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved. i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. i was aware also that i should often lose all self-command all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed. once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. my promise fulfilled the monster would depart for ever. or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever. these feelings dictated my answer to my father. i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself. the duration of my absence was left to my own choice a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated. one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh. this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection. nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. my fathers age rendered him extremely averse to delay. for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her. i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure. but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations. it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country. my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief. it had been her care which provided me a companion in clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans sedulous attention. she longed to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell. i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around. i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured. after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i waited two days for clerval. he came. alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day. he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. this is what it is to live he cried now i enjoy existence but you my dear frankenstein wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine. and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections. i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment. we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london. during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrived at mainz. the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque. the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms. we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible. this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape. in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene. we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labou as we glided down the stream. even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased. i lay at t bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger. and if the were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he h been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where t snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting bl and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appear were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout mus on the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mounta where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de v but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders. the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalle look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. oh surely the spirit that inha and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those wh pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains o our own country. clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words a to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. he was being formed in the very poetry of nature. his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look fo in the imagination. but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. the scenery of external nature which others re only with admiration he loved with ardour— ——the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrowd from the eye. [wordsworths tintern abbey.] and where does he now exist is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creator—has this mind perished does it now only exist in my memory no it is not thus your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend. pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. i will proceed with my tale. beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland and we resolved t post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary and the stream the river was too gentle to aid us. our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to engla it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first the white cliffs of britain. the banks of the thames presented a new sc they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spani armada gravesend woolwich and greenwich—places which i had heard of even in my country. at length we saw the numerous steeples of london st. pauls towering above all and the tower famed in english history. chapter 19 london was our present point of rest we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers. if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. company was irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish. but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade. in britain only could he further the execution of his plan. he was for ever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone. i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate. after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva. he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficien allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided. clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation an although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling-pla we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february. we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxf matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completio this tour about the end of july. i packed up my chemical instruments an the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland. we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest. this was a new scene to us mountaineers the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us. from thence we proceeded to oxford. as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. it was here that charles i. had collected his forces. this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we delighted to trace its footsteps. if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. the colleges are ancient and picturesque the streets are almost magnificent and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees. i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. i was formed for peaceful happiness. during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by ennui the sight of wh is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. but i am a blasted tree the bolt has entered my soul and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself. we passed a considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history. our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self. we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest. the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix. the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated. from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland. i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains. the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. i could pass my life here said he to me and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine. but he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. his feelings are for ever on the stretch and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties. we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on. for my own part i was not sorry. i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the dæmons disappointment. he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. i waited for my letters with feverish impatience if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me. i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime. i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. clerval did not like it so as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to hi but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romanti castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthurs seat st. bernards well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st. andrews and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us. but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone. do you said i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous. i may be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you leave me to peace and solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper. henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate. he entreated me to write often. i had rather be with you he said in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence. having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude. i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion. with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on on the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours. it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides continually beaten upon by the waves. the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy l gave tokens of their miserable fare. vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured fro the mainland which was about five miles distant. on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived. this i hired. it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges. i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. as it was i lived ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men. in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. it was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. i thought of switzerland it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean. in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work. it was indeed a filthy process in which i was engaged. during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands. thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless and nervous. every moment i feared to meet my persecutor. sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold. i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion. in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced. i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom. chapter 20 i sat one evening in my laboratory the sun had set and the moon was j rising from the sea i had not sufficient light for my employment and remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attenti to it. as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing. three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitter remorse. i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i alike ignorant she might become ten thousand times more malignant than mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness. he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but had not and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. they might even hate each other the creature who already liv loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorren for it when it came before his eyes in the female form she also might with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new wo yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated up the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. had i right for my own benefi to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations i had before been m by the sophisms of the being i had created i had been struck senseless his fiendish threats but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shuddered to think that future ages might curs as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race. i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. yes he had followed me in my travels he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise. as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged. the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew. i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours and then with trembling steps i sought my own apartment. i was alone none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries. several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house. in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. i trembled from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine but i was overcome by the sensati of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot. presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage the door opened and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared. shutting the door he approached me and said in a smothered voice you have destroyed the work which you began what is it that you intend do you dare to break your promise i have endured toil and mise i left switzerland with you i crept along the shores of the rhine amo its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland. i ha endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do you dare destroy hopes begone i do break my promise never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and wickedness. slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. remember that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. you are my creator but i am your master obey the hour of my irresolution is past and the period of your power is arrived. your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice. shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage. the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in th impotence of anger. shall each man cried he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn. man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness f ever. are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other passions but revenge remains—revenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on y misery. beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful. i will watch the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom. man you shal repent of the injuries you inflict. devil cease and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words. leave me i am inexorable. it is well. i go but remember i shall be with you on your wedding-night. i started forward and exclaimed villain before you sign my death-warrant be sure that you are yourself safe. i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation. in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves. all was again silent but his words rang in my ears. i burned with rage pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife but i had suffered h to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland. i shudd to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate reven and then i thought again of his words—i will be with you on your wedding-night. that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny. in that hour i should die and at once satisfy extinguish his malice. the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the firs had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to before my enemy without a bitter struggle. the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean my feelings bec calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks in the depths of despair. i left the house the horrid scene of the last nights contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is t but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. if i returned it was be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of dæmon whom i had myself created. i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation. when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishing-boat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him. he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise. he could not any longer delay his departure but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare. he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together. this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days. yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shudder to reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpos must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work and i m handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the do of my laboratory. the remains of the half-finished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being. i paused to collect myself a then entered the chamber. with trembling hand i conveyed the instrument out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics o work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants and i accordin put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying the up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus. nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly. the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion. between two and three in the morning the moon rose and i then putting basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shor the scene was perfectly solitary a few boats were returning towards la but i sailed away from them. i felt as if i was about the commission of dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with m fellow creatures. at one time the moon which had before been clear wa suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the momen darkness and cast my basket into the sea i listened to the gurgling so as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. the sky became clouded the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was the rising. but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensation that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. clouds hid moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as keel cut through the waves the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly. i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably. the wind was high the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast which i had embarked. i endeavoured to change my course but quickly fou that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled wit water. thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind. i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror. i had no compass with m and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. i might be driven into wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed u the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. i had alrea been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude my other sufferings. i looked on the heavens which were covered by clo that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others i looked upon sea it was to be my grave. fiend i exclaimed your task is already fulfilled i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clerval—all left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. this idea plunged me into a reverie despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point closing before me for ever i shudder to reflect on it. some hours passed thus but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. but these gave place to a heavy swell i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south. almost spent as i was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes. how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. it had wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceive the traces of cultivation. i saw vessels near the shore and found mysel suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. as i was in a state extreme debility i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a pl where i could most easily procure nourishment. fortunately i had money me. as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot. they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language. my good friends said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am you will know that soon enough replied a man with a hoarse voice. maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consulted as to your quarters i promise you. i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. why do you answer me so roughly i replied. surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably. i do not know said the man what the custom of the english may be but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains. while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase. their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. i inquired the way to the inn b no one replied. i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said come sir you must follow me to kirwins to give an account of yourself. who is kirwin why am i to give an account of myself is not this a free country ay sir free enough for honest folks. kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night. this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself. i was innoce that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in sil and was led to one of the best houses in the town. i was ready to sink fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it polit to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed apprehension or conscious guilt. little did i then expect the calamity was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despa all fear of ignominy or death. i must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memor the frightful events which i am about to relate in proper detail to m recollection. chapter 21 i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before wi his son and brother-in-law daniel nugent when about ten oclock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put for port. it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek a two miles below. he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tac and his companions followed him at some distance. as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a m who was to all appearance dead. their first supposition was that it was corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by t waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and that the body was not then cold. they instantly carried it to the cotta of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore to life. it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age. he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign o any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck. the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner. the son confirmed his fathers account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the sa boat in which i had just landed. a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the d of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corps was afterwards found. another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold. they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone. several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed. besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where i had deposited the corpse. kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken in the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed wh effect the sight of it would produce upon me. this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. i was accordingly conducted by the magistra and several other persons to the inn. i could not help being struck by strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night b knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. h can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering an agony. the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henr clerval stretched before me. i gasped for breath and throwing myself o the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor— the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured and i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions. a fever succeeded to this. i lay for two months on the point of death ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval. sometimes i entreated attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already gras my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror. fortunately as i sp my native language kirwin alone understood me but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses. why did i not die more miserable than man ever was before why did i n sink into forgetfulness and rest death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning o the wheel continually renewed the torture but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly. this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me in english and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings. are you better now sir said she. i replied in the same language with a feeble voice i believe i am but if it be all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror. for that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however thats none of my business i am sent to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it were well if everybody did the same. i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality. as the images that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish a darkness pressed around me no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand supported me. the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee these were my first reflections but i soon learned that kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best) and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals. one day while i was gradually recovering i was seated in a chair my half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. i was overcome by gl and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. at one tim considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been. such were thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and kirwin entere his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion he drew a chair clos mine and addressed me in french i fear that this place is very shocking to you can i do anything to make you more comfortable i thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving. i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge. that is my least concern i am by a course of strange events become the most miserable of mortals. persecuted and tortured as i am and have been can death be any evil to me nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred. you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder. the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path. as kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for kirwin hastened to say immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfor and illness. i found several letters and among others one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father. i instantly wr to geneva nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my let but you are ill even now you tremble you are unfit for agitation of a kind. this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event tell me what new scene of death has been acted and whose murder i am now to lament your family is perfectly well said kirwin with gentleness and someone a friend is come to visit you. i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires. i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony oh take him away i cannot see him for gods sake do not let him enter kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. he could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone i should have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance. my father cried i while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. is my father indeed come how kind how very kind but where is he why does he not hasten to me my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it. nothing at this moment could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. i stretched out my hand to him and cried are you then safe—and elizabeth—and ernest my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured b dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode cheerfulness. what a place is this that you inhabit my son said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearan of the room. you travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you. and poor clerval— the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state i shed tears. alas yes my father replied i some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me and i must live to fulfil it or sure should have died on the coffin of henry. we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health. as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. the image of clerval was for ever before me ghastly and murdered. more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny which is now drawing to a close. soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest. then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins. the season of the assizes approached. i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death. the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison. my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. the cup of life was poisoned for ever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt. my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but these words only drew deep groans from me. sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring maladie du pays to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence. yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair. it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. my strength was gone. i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame. still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatien my father thought it best to yield. we took our passage on board a vess bound for havre-de-grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish sho it was midnight. i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening t the dashing of the waves. i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i sh soon see geneva. the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dr yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and deares companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. i repassed in my memory my whole life my quiet happiness while residin with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt. i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried m to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived. i was unable to pursue the train of thought a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly. ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taki every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this d only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation life. oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. but sleep not afford me respite from thought and misery my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me. towards morning i was possessed by a k of nightmare i felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groans and cries rang in my ears. my father who was watching over me perceiving my restlessness awoke me the dashing wav were around the cloudy sky above the fiend was not here a sense of security a feeling that a truce was established between the present ho and the irresistible disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible. chapter 22 the voyage came to an end. we landed and proceeded to paris. i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey. my fathers care and attentions were indefatigable but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. he wished me to seek amusement in society. i abhorred the face of man. oh not abhorred they were my brethren my fellow beings and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse. i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. alas my father said i how little do you know me. human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if a wretch as i felt pride. justine poor unhappy justine was as innocen as i and she suffered the same charge she died for it and i am the c of this—i murdered her. william justine and henry—they all died by my hands. my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had prese itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i preserved in my convalescence. i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created. i had a persuasion that i should b supposed mad and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmate his breast. i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal sec yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. upon this occasion my father said with an expression of unbounded wond my dearest victor what infatuation is this my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again. i am not mad i cried energetically the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth. i am the assassin of those most innocent victims they died by my machinations. a thousand times would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race. the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes. as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. by the utmost self-violence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice. a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland i received t following letter from elizabeth my dear friend it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva. this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity. yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time. i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet. explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisf but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and be pleased with this explanation and in a probability of this being th case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to b you well know victor that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. we were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. we were affectionate playfellows during childhood and i believe dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. but as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be our case tell me dearest victor. answer me i conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truth—do you not love another you have travelled you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt and i confess to you my friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying to solitude from the society of every creature i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. but this is false reasoning. i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. even now i weep to think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word honour all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. ah victor be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one request remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity. do not let this letter disturb you do not answer tomorrow or the next day or even until you come if it will give you pain. my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness. elizabeth lavenza. geneva may 18th 17— this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten the threa the fiend—i will be with you on your wedding-night such was my sentence and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. on that night had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. well be it so a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place in which if he were victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. if were vanquished i should be a free man. alas what freedom such as th peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste and he is turned adrift homeless penniless and alone but free. such would be my liberty except that in elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death. sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy but the apple was already eaten and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope. yet i would die to make her happy. if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable ye again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. he had vo to be with me on my wedding-night yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me th he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour. in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth. my letter was calm and affectionate. i fear my beloved girl i said little happiness remains for us on earth yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you. chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. i have one secret elizabeth a dreadful one when revealed to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured. i will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confidence between us. but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude to it. this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply. in about a week after the arrival of elizabeths letter we returned to geneva. the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection yet tears we in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. i saw change in her also. she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me but her gentleness and soft looks compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable was. the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure. memory brought mad with it and when i thought of what had passed a real insanity possess me sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage sometimes low and despondent. i neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits her gentle vo would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. she wept with me and for me. when reason returned she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned but for guilty there is no peace. the agonies of remorse poison the luxury ther otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with elizabeth. i remained silent. have you then some other attachment none on earth. i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. let the day therefore be fixed and on it i will consecrate myself in life or death to the happiness of my cousin. my dear victor do not speak thus. heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. and when time shall have softened your despair new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived. such were the lessons of my father. but to me the remembrance of the threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood i should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words i shall be with you on your wedding-night i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it and i therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as i imagined the seal to my fate. great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. but as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real intentions and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death i hastened that of a far dearer victim. as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer whether from cowardic a prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink within me. but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to th countenance of my father but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nic eye of elizabeth. she looked forward to our union with placid contentme not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissip into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret. preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were receiv and all wore a smiling appearance. i shut up as well as i could in my heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestnes into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government. a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her. i was agreed that immediately after our union we should proceed to vill lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood. in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me. i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent. elizabeth seemed happy my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny she was melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervaded her and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day. my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride. after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. the day was fair the wind favourable all smiled on our nuptial embarkation. those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness. we passed rapidly along the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont salêve the pleasant banks of montalègre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. i took the hand of elizabeth. you are sorrowful my love. ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy. be happy my dear victor replied elizabeth there is i hope nothing to distress you and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is contented. something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us but i will not listen to such a sinister voice. observe how fast we move along and how the clouds which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting. look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. but her temper was fluctuating joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie. the sun sank lower in the heavens we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. the alps here come closer to the lake and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. the spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung. the wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as i touched the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever. chapter 23 it was eight oclock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines. the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west. the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind. i was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom every sound terrified me but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished. elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful sile but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her trembling she asked what is it that agitates you my dear victor what is it you fear oh peace peace my love replied i this night and all will be safe but this night is dreadful very dreadful. i passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflected how fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife and i earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. she left me and i continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream. it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired. as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. this state lasted but for an instant the scream was repeated and i rushed into the room. great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. everywher turn i see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. for a mome only did i lose recollection i fell senseless on the ground. when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn th countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love wife so lately living so dear so worthy. she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might hav supposed her asleep. i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now he in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherishe the murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chambe the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not t described i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhor a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. i rushed towa the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom fired but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake. the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. i pointed to the spot where he had disappeared and we followed the track with boats nets were cast but in vain. after passing several hours we returned hopeless most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines. i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house but my head whirled round my steps were like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost. after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. there were women weeping around i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind but my thoughts rambled to various subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. the death of william the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet. this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed. there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents. however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night. i hired to row and took an oar myself for i had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. but the overflowing misery i now fel and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. i threw down the oar and leaning my head upon my hands gave to every gloomy idea that arose. if i looked up i saw scenes which wer familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollectio tears streamed from my eyes. the rain had ceased for a moment and i sa the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before they h then been observed by elizabeth. nothing is so painful to the human min a great and sudden change. the sun might shine or the clouds might lowe but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. a fiend h snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever b so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history o man. but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached the acme and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you. know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate. m own strength is exhausted and i must tell in a few words what remain my hideous narration. i arrived at geneva. my father and ernest yet lived but the former sun under the tidings that i bore. i see him now excellent and venerable o man his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm and th delight—his elizabeth his more than daughter whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels who in the decline of life havin few affections clings more earnestly to those that remain. cursed cur be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to wa in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumula around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way he was unable t rise from his bed and in a few days he died in my arms. what then became of me i know not i lost sensation and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon. melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation. liberty however had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awakened to reason at the same time awakened to revenge. as the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me i began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom i had created the miserable dæmon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head. nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose about a month after my release i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. be assured sir said he no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain. i thank you replied i listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make. it is indeed a tale so strange that i should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which however wonderful forces conviction. the story is too connected be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood. my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm i had formed in own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpos quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. i now relat my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates w accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation. the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i contin he became more attentive and interested i saw him sometimes shudder wi horror at others a lively surprise unmingled with disbelief was pain on his countenance. when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert yo whole power. it is your duty as a magistrate and i believe and hope th your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion. this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is gi to a tale of spirits and supernatural events but when he was called up to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity returned. he however answered mildly i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears t have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. who can follo animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens whe no man would venture to intrude besides some months have elapsed sinc the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place h has wandered or what region he may now inhabit. i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamo and destroyed as a beast of prey. but i perceive your thoughts you do credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert. as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated. you are mistaken said he. i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. but i fear from what you have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you sho make up your mind to disappointment. that cannot be but all that i can say will be of little avail. my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists. you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction. i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. but to a genevan magistrate whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium. man i cried how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease you know not what it is you say. i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action. chapter 24 my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. i was hurried away by fury revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion. my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever my country which whe was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful. i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jew which had belonged to my mother and departed. and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardship which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. h have lived i hardly know many times have i stretched my failing limbs the sandy plain and prayed for death. but revenge kept me alive i dare not die and leave my adversary in being. when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue. as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed. i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner. the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way t rage and despair. they were dead and i lived their murderer also live and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence. i knelt on the g and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by th deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and spirits that preside over thee to pursue the dæmon who caused this mis until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict. for this purpose i will preserve my life to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish fro eyes for ever. and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wand ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work. let the curse and hellish monster drink deep of agony let him feel the despair that torments me. i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assure that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance. i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains re-echoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance. the laughter died away when a well-known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied. i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp. suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed. i pursued him and for many months this has been my task. guided by a slight clue i followed the windings of the rhone but vainly. the blue mediterranean appeared and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea. i took my passage in the same ship but he escaped i know not how. amidst the wilds of tartary and russia although he still evaded me i have ever followed in his track. sometimes the peasants scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me. the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigue were the least pains which i was destined to endure i was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had invoked to aid me. often when all was dry the heavens cloudless and i was parched by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drops that revived me and vanish. i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the dæmon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. in other places human beings were seldom seen and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it or i brought with me some food that i had killed which after taking a small part i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy. o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. t spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. deprive this respite i should have sunk under my hardships. during the day i w sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth. often when wearie a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night sh come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling t their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as th ardent desire of my soul. what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know. sometimes indeed left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that gu me and instigated my fury. my reign is not yet over—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—you live and my power is complete. follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north where you will feel the misery cold and frost to which i am impassive. you will find near this place you follow not too tardily a dead hare eat and be refreshed. come on enemy we have yet to wrestle for our lives but many hard and miserabl hours must you endure until that period shall arrive. scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death. never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy shall i join my elizabeth and my departed friends who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage as i still pursued my journey to the northward the snows thickened and cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. the peasants w shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured fort seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places t seek for prey. the rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. on inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon e upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred. my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words i resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. i did not weep but i knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversarys gibe to meet and grapple with him. some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. i know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but i found that as before i had daily lost ground in the pursuit i now gained on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean he was but one days journey in advance and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror-struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts. on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair. he had escaped me and i must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive. yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling. after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge i prepared for my journey. i exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions i departed from land. i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage and i often heard the thunder of the ground sea which threatened my destruction. but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure. by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery. once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dæmon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud. but this was not the time for delay i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hours rest which was absolutely necessary and yet which was bitterly irksome to me i continued my route. the sledge was still visible nor did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant my heart bounded within me. but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i ever done before. a ground sea was heard the thunder of its progress the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more omin and terrific. i pressed on but in vain. the wind arose the sea roared and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked wi tremendous and overwhelming sound. the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death. in this manner many appalling hours passed several of my dogs died an myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and li i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astound at the sight. i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft the direction of your ship. i had determined if you were going southwa still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pu my enemy. but your direction was northwards. you took me on board when vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled. oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the dæmon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no i am not so selfish. yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart but trust him not. his soul is as hellish as his form full of treachery and fiend-like malice. hear him not call on the names of william justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart. i will hover near and direct the steel aright. walton in continuation. august 26th 17—. you have read this strange and terrific story margaret and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdles mine sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. his fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice suppressing every mark of agitation then like a volcano bursting forth his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor. his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie which he showed m and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations however earnest and connected. such a monster has then really existen i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surprise and admiration. sometimes endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his creatures formation but on this point he was impenetrable. are you mad my friend said he. or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you would you also create for yourself and th world a demoniacal enemy peace peace learn my miseries and do not se to increase your own. frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history he as to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many place but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he h with his enemy. since you have preserved my narration said he i would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity. thus has a week passed away while i have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live oh no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. yet he enjoys one comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance that they are not the creations of his fancy but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth. our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. his eloquence is forcible and touching nor can i hear him when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love without tears. what a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin he seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall. when younger said he i believed myself destined for some great enterprise. my feelings are profound but i possessed a cool of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. this sentiment the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppress for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents t might be useful to my fellow creatures. when i reflected on the work i completed no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. but this thought which supported me in the commencement of my career now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. all my speculations and hop are as nothing and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence i am chained in an eternal hell. my imagination was vivid yet my powers of analysis and application were intense by the union of these qualities conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. even now i canno recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. i heaven in my thoughts now exulting in my powers now burning with the of their effects. from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lo ambition but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i on was you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. desponden rarely visited my heart a high destiny seemed to bear me on until i f never never again to rise. must i then lose this admirable being i have longed for a friend i ha sought one who would sympathise with and love me. behold on these dese seas i have found such a one but i fear i have gained him only to know value and lose him. i would reconcile him to life but he repulses the i thank you walton he said for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone can any man be to me as clerval was or any woman another elizabeth even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. they know our infantine dispositions which however they may be afterwards modified are never eradicated and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however strongly he may be attached may in spite of himself be contemplated with suspicion. but i enjoyed friends dear not only through habit and association but from their own merits and wherever i am the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. they are dead and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. if i were engaged in any high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures then could i live to fulfil it. but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die. my beloved sister september 2d. i write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it. i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. the brave fellows whom i have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow. there is something terribly appalling in our situation yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. if we are lost my mad schemes are the cause. and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear o destruction and you will anxiously await my return. years will pass a you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. oh my beloved sister the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations i in prospect more terrible to me than my own death. but you have a husb and lovely children you may be happy. heaven bless you and make you so my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. he reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea and in spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries. even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence when he speaks they no longer despair he rouses their energies and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. these feelings are transitory each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair. september 5th. a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you yet i cannot forbear recording it. we are still surrounded by mountains of ice still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. the cold is excessive and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. frankenstein has daily declined in health a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is exhausted and when suddenly roused to any exertion he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness. i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny. this morning as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—i was roused by half a dozen of the sailors who demanded admission into the cabin. they entered and their leader addressed me. he told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which in justice i could not refuse. we were immured in ice and should probably never escape but they feared that if as was possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this. they insisted therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards. this speech troubled me. i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. yet could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had at first been silent and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now roused himself his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. turning towards the men he said what do you mean what do you demand of your captain are you then so easily turned from your design did you not call this a glorious expedition and wherefore was it glorious not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea but because it was full of dangers terror because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called f and your courage exhibited because danger and death surrounded it and these you were to brave and overcome. for this was it a glorious for t was it an honourable undertaking. you were hereafter to be hailed as th benefactors of your species your names adored as belonging to brave me who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. and now behold with the first imagination of danger or if you will the firs mighty and terrific trial of your courage you shrink away and are cont to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril and so poor souls they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. why that requires not this preparation ye need not have co thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to pr yourselves cowards. oh be men or be more than men. be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that i shall not. do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. return as heroes who have fought and conquered an who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe. he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expre in his speech with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism that ca you wonder that these men were moved they looked at one another and we unable to reply. i spoke i told them to retire and consider of what ha been said that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary but that i hoped that with reflection their cou would return. they retired and i turned towards my friend but he was sunk in languor almost deprived of life. how all this will terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled. yet i fear such will be my fate the men unsupported by ideas of glory and honour can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships. september 7th. the die is cast i have consented to return if we are not destroyed. thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision i come back ignorant and disappointed. it requires more philosophy than i possess to bear this injustice with patience. september 12th. it is past i am returning to england. i have lost my hopes of utility and glory i have lost my friend. but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond. september 9th the ice began to move and roarings like thunder were he at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. we w in the most imminent peril but as we could only remain passive my chi attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. the ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north a breeze sprang the west and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectl free. when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumultuous joy broke from th loud and long-continued. frankenstein who was dozing awoke and asked cause of the tumult. they shout i said because they will soon return to england. do you then really return alas yes i cannot withstand their demands. i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger and i must return. do so if you will but i will not. you may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to me by heaven and i dare not. i am weak but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength. saying this he endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him he fell back and fainted. it was long before he was restored and i often thought that life was entirely extinct. at length he opened his eyes he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live. his sentence was pronounced and i could only grieve and be patient. i by his bed watching him his eyes were closed and i thought he slept presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said alas the strength i relied on is gone i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and persecutor may still be in being. think not walton that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burni hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. during these last days have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do i find it blama in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness a well-being. this was my duty but there was another still paramount to that. my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. urged by this view i refused and i did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature. he showed unparalleled malig and selfishness in evil he destroyed my friends he devoted to destruc beings who possessed exquisite sensations happiness and wisdom nor d know where this thirst for vengeance may end. miserable himself that he render no other wretched he ought to die. the task of his destruction mine but i have failed. when actuated by selfish and vicious motives asked you to undertake my unfinished work and i renew this request now when i am only induced by reason and virtue. yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task and now that you are returning to england you will have little chance of meeting with him. but the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties i leave to you my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may still be misled by passion. that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me in other respects this hour when i momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years. the forms of the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arms. farewell walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. yet why do i say this i have myself been blasted in these hopes yet another may succeed. his voice became fainter as he spoke and at length exhausted by his effort he sank into silence. about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile passe away from his lips. margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble. my tears flow my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. but i journey towards england and i may there find consolation. i am interrupted. what do these sounds portend it is midnight the breeze blows fairly and the watch on deck scarcely stir. again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie. i must arise and examine. good night my sister. great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. i hardly know whether i shall have the power to deta it yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprun towards the window. never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. i shut my eyes involuntarily endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destro i called on him to stay. he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion. that is also my victim he exclaimed. in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to it close oh frankenstein generous and self-devoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed by destroying all thou lovedst. alas he is cold he cannot answer me. his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to hi face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips. the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his pas your repentance i said is now superfluous. if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remors before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived. and do you dream said the dæmon. do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he he continued pointing to the corpse he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. oh not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse. think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine. after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heart-broken and overcome. i pitied frankenstein my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself. but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitte indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey. yet when she died nay then i was not miserable. i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair. evil thenceforth became my good. urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen. the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. and now it is ended there is my last victim i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i ca to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me. wretch i said. it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they ar consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. hypocritical fie if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again w he become the prey of your accursed vengeance. it is not pity that you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power. oh it is not thus—not thus interrupted the being. yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my mis no sympathy may i ever find. when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole bei overflowed that i wished to be participated. but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure when i die i well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. on my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment. i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form wou love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding. i nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine. when i run over frightful catalogue of my sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. but it is even so t fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. yet even that enemy of god and had friends and associates in his desolation i am alone. you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions. for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires. they were for ever ardent and craving stil i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned. was there no injustice in this am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on. even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice. but it is true that i am a wretch. i have murdered the lovely and the helpless i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped t death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love a admiration among men to misery i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. there he lies white and cold in death. you hate me your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself. i look on hands which executed the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hand will meet my eyes when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief. my work is nearly complete. neither yours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be don but it requires my own. do not think that i shall be slow to perform th sacrifice. i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe i shal collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame that remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who wo create such another as i have been. i shall die. i shall no longer feel agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied ye unquenched. he is dead who called me into being and when i shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. light feeling and sense will pass away and in this condition must i find my happiness. some years ago when the images which this world affords fir opened upon me when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds and these were al me i should have wept to die now it is my only consolation. polluted crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse where can i find rest but in death farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. but it was not so thou didst seek my extinction that i might not cause greater wretchedness and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceased to think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel. blasted as thou wert my agony was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever. but soon he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt. soon these burning miseries will be extinct. i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly a exult in the agony of the torturing flames. the light of that conflagra will fade away my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. my sp will sleep in peace or if it thinks it will not surely think thus. farewell. he sprang from the cabin-window as he said this upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. he was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance. *** end of the project gutenberg ebook frankenstein *** ***** this file should be named
